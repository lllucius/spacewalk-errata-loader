Ubuntu Security Notice USN-2886-1
February 01, 2016

linux vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

Software Description:
- linux: Linux kernel

Details:

It was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the
AF_UNIX implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use
crafted epoll_ctl calls to cause a denial of service (system crash) or
expose sensitive information. (CVE-2013-7446)

It was discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel did not
properly restore the values of the Programmable Interrupt Timer (PIT). A
user-assisted attacker in a KVM guest could cause a denial of service in
the host (system crash). (CVE-2015-7513)

??? discovered that the ppp implementation in the Linux kernel did
not ensure that certain slot numbers are valid. A local attacker with the
privilege to call ioctl() on /dev/ppp could cause a denial of service
(system crash). (CVE-2015-7799)

Sasha Levin discovered that the Reliable Datagram Sockets (RDS)
implementation in the Linux kernel had a race condition when checking
whether a socket was bound or not. A local attacker could use this to cause
a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2015-7990)

It was discovered that the Btrfs implementation in the Linux kernel
incorrectly handled compressed inline extants on truncation. A local
attacker could use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2015-8374)

??? discovered that the Linux kernel networking implementation did
not validate protocol identifiers for certain protocol families, A local
attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or
possibly gain administrative privileges. (CVE-2015-8543)

Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the pptp implementation in the Linux kernel
did not verify an address length when setting up a socket. A local attacker
could use this to craft an application that exposed sensitive information
from kernel memory. (CVE-2015-8569)

David Miller discovered that the Bluetooth implementation in the Linux
kernel did not properly validate the socket address length for Synchronous
Connection-Oriented (SCO) sockets. A local attacker could use this to
expose sensitive information. (CVE-2015-8575)

It was discovered that the Linux kernel's Filesystem in Userspace (FUSE)
implementation did not handle initial zero length segments properly. A
local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (unkillable
task). (CVE-2015-8785)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:
  linux-image-3.2.0-98-generic    3.2.0-98.138
  linux-image-3.2.0-98-generic-pae  3.2.0-98.138
  linux-image-3.2.0-98-highbank   3.2.0-98.138
  linux-image-3.2.0-98-omap       3.2.0-98.138
  linux-image-3.2.0-98-powerpc-smp  3.2.0-98.138
  linux-image-3.2.0-98-powerpc64-smp  3.2.0-98.138
  linux-image-3.2.0-98-virtual    3.2.0-98.138

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.
Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages
(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,
linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform
this as well.

implementation in the Linux kernel had a race condition when checking
whether a socket was bound or not. A local attacker could use this to cause
a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2015-7990)

It was discovered that the Btrfs implementation in the Linux kernel
incorrectly handled compressed inline extants on truncation. A local
attacker could use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2015-8374)

??? discovered that the Linux kernel networking implementation did
not validate protocol identifiers for certain protocol families, A local
attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or
possibly gain administrative privileges. (CVE-2015-8543)

Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the pptp implementation in the Linux kernel
did not verify an address length when setting up a socket. A local attacker
could use this to craft an application that exposed sensitive information
from kernel memory. (CVE-2015-8569)

David Miller discovered that the Bluetooth implementation in the Linux
kernel did not properly validate the socket address length for Synchronous
Connection-Oriented (SCO) sockets. A local attacker could use this to
expose sensitive information. (CVE-2015-8575)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 14.04 LTS:
  linux-image-3.16.0-60-generic   3.16.0-60.80~14.04.1
  linux-image-3.16.0-60-generic-lpae  3.16.0-60.80~14.04.1
  linux-image-3.16.0-60-lowlatency  3.16.0-60.80~14.04.1
  linux-image-3.16.0-60-powerpc-e500mc  3.16.0-60.80~14.04.1
  linux-image-3.16.0-60-powerpc-smp  3.16.0-60.80~14.04.1
  linux-image-3.16.0-60-powerpc64-emb  3.16.0-60.80~14.04.1
  linux-image-3.16.0-60-powerpc64-smp  3.16.0-60.80~14.04.1

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.
Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages
(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,
linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform
this as well.

linux vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 15.04

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

Software Description:
- linux: Linux kernel

Details:

It was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the
AF_UNIX implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use
crafted epoll_ctl calls to cause a denial of service (system crash) or
expose sensitive information. (CVE-2013-7446)

It was discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel did not
properly restore the values of the Programmable Interrupt Timer (PIT). A
user-assisted attacker in a KVM guest could cause a denial of service in
the host (system crash). (CVE-2015-7513)

Sasha Levin discovered that the Reliable Datagram Sockets (RDS)
implementation in the Linux kernel had a race condition when checking
whether a socket was bound or not. A local attacker could use this to cause
a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2015-7990)

It was discovered that the Btrfs implementation in the Linux kernel
incorrectly handled compressed inline extants on truncation. A local
attacker could use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2015-8374)

It was discovered that the netfilter Network Address Translation (NAT)
implementation did not ensure that data structures were initialized when
handling IPv4 addresses. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of
service (system crash). (CVE-2015-8787)

Update instructions:

Subject: Ubuntu 15.04 (Vivid Vervet) End of Life reached on February 4 2016
Message-ID: <20160205035455.GA1296@0c3.net>

This is a follow-up to the End of Life warning sent last month to
confirm that as of today (February 4, 2016), Ubuntu 15.04 is no longer
supported.  No more package updates will be accepted to 15.04, and
it will be archived to old-releases.ubuntu.com in the coming weeks.

The original End of Life warning follows, with upgrade instructions:

Ubuntu announced its 15.04 (Vivid Vervet) release almost 9 months
ago, on April 23, 2015.  As a non-LTS release, 15.04 has a 9-month
month support cycle and, as such, the support period is now nearing
its end and Ubuntu 15.04 will reach end of life on Thursday, February
4th.  At that time, Ubuntu Security Notices will no longer include
information or updated packages for Ubuntu 15.04.

The supported upgrade path from Ubuntu 15.04 is via Ubuntu 15.10.
Instructions and caveats for the upgrade may be found at:

https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WilyUpgrades

Ubuntu 15.10 continues to be actively supported with security updates
and select high-impact bug fixes.  Announcements of security updates
for Ubuntu releases are sent to the ubuntu-security-announce mailing
list, information about which may be found at:

https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/ubuntu-security-announce

Since its launch in October 2004 Ubuntu has become one of the most
highly regarded Linux distributions with millions of users in homes,
schools, businesses and governments around the world. Ubuntu is Open
Source software, costs nothing to download, and users are free to
customise or alter their software in order to meet their needs.

On behalf of the Ubuntu Release Team,

Adam Conrad

Subject: [USN-2880-2] Firefox regression
Message-ID: <56B8FE6A.2080003@canonical.com>

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-2880-2
February 08, 2016

firefox regression
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 15.10
- Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

Summary:

USN-2880-1 introduced a regression in Firefox.

Software Description:
- firefox: Mozilla Open Source web browser

Details:

USN-2880-1 fixed vulnerabilities in Firefox. This update introduced a
regression which caused Firefox to crash on startup with some configurations.
This update fixes the problem.

We apologize for the inconvenience.

Original advisory details:

 Bob Clary, Christian Holler, Nils Ohlmeier, Gary Kwong, Jesse Ruderman,
 Carsten Book, Randell Jesup, Nicolas Pierron, Eric Rescorla, Tyson Smith,
 and Gabor Krizsanits discovered multiple memory safety issues in Firefox.
 If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an
 attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via
 application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the
 user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2016-1930, CVE-2016-1931)
 
 Gustavo Grieco discovered an out-of-memory crash when loading GIF images
 in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially
 crafted website, an attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of
 service. (CVE-2016-1933)
 
 Aki Helin discovered a buffer overflow when rendering WebGL content in
 some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially
 crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a
 denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with
 the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2016-1935)
 
 It was discovered that a delay was missing when focusing the protocol
 handler dialog. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted
 website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to conduct
 clickjacking attacks. (CVE-2016-1937)
 
 Hanno B?ck discovered that calculations with mp_div and mp_exptmod in NSS
 produce incorrect results in some circumstances, resulting in
 cryptographic weaknesses. (CVE-2016-1938)
 
 Nicholas Hurley discovered that Firefox allows for control characters to
 be set in cookie names. An attacker could potentially exploit this to
 conduct cookie injection attacks on some web servers. (CVE-2016-1939)
 
 It was discovered that when certain invalid URLs are pasted in to the
 addressbar, the addressbar contents may be manipulated to show the
 location of arbitrary websites. An attacker could potentially exploit this
 to conduct URL spoofing attacks. (CVE-2016-1942)
 
 Ronald Crane discovered three vulnerabilities through code inspection. If
 a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker
 could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via
 application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the
 user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2016-1944, CVE-2016-1945, CVE-2016-1946)
 
 Fran?ois Marier discovered that Application Reputation lookups didn't
 work correctly, disabling warnings for potentially malicious downloads. An
 attacker could potentially exploit this by tricking a user in to
 downloading a malicious file. Other parts of the Safe Browsing feature
 were unaffected by this. (CVE-2016-1947)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 15.10:
  firefox                         44.0.1+build2-0ubuntu0.15.10.1

Ubuntu 14.04 LTS:

cpio vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 15.10
- Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in GNU cpio.

Software Description:
- cpio: a tool to manage archives of files

Details:

Alexander Cherepanov discovered that GNU cpio incorrectly handled symbolic
links when used with the --no-absolute-filenames option. If a user or
automated system were tricked into extracting a specially-crafted cpio
archive, a remote attacker could possibly use this issue to write arbitrary
files. This issue only affected Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.
(CVE-2015-1197)

Gustavo Grieco discovered that GNU cpio incorrectly handled memory when
extracting archive files. If a user or automated system were tricked into
extracting a specially-crafted cpio archive, a remote attacker could use
this issue to cause GNU cpio to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or
possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-2037)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 15.10:
  cpio                            2.11+dfsg-4.1ubuntu1.1

Ubuntu 14.04 LTS:
  cpio                            2.11+dfsg-1ubuntu1.2

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:
  cpio                            2.11-7ubuntu3.2

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.

linux vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

Software Description:
- linux: Linux kernel

Details:

halfdog discovered that OverlayFS, when mounting on top of a FUSE mount,
incorrectly propagated file attributes, including setuid. A local
unprivileged attacker could use this to gain privileges. (CVE-2016-1576)

halfdog discovered that OverlayFS in the Linux kernel incorrectly
propagated security sensitive extended attributes, such as
POSIX ACLs. A local unprivileged attacker could use this to gain
privileges. (CVE-2016-1575)

It was discovered that the Linux kernel keyring subsystem contained a race
between read and revoke operations. A local attacker could use this to
cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2015-7550)

??? discovered that the Linux kernel networking implementation did
not validate protocol identifiers for certain protocol families, A local
attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or
possibly gain administrative privileges. (CVE-2015-8543)

Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the pptp implementation in the Linux kernel
did not verify an address length when setting up a socket. A local attacker
could use this to craft an application that exposed sensitive information
from kernel memory. (CVE-2015-8569)

David Miller discovered that the Bluetooth implementation in the Linux
kernel did not properly validate the socket address length for Synchronous
Connection-Oriented (SCO) sockets. A local attacker could use this to
expose sensitive information. (CVE-2015-8575)

It was discovered that the Linux kernel's Filesystem in Userspace (FUSE)
implementation did not handle initial zero length segments properly. A
local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (unkillable
task). (CVE-2015-8785)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 14.04 LTS:
  linux-image-3.13.0-79-generic   3.13.0-79.123
  linux-image-3.13.0-79-generic-lpae  3.13.0-79.123
  linux-image-3.13.0-79-lowlatency  3.13.0-79.123
  linux-image-3.13.0-79-powerpc-e500  3.13.0-79.123
  linux-image-3.13.0-79-powerpc-e500mc  3.13.0-79.123
  linux-image-3.13.0-79-powerpc-smp  3.13.0-79.123
  linux-image-3.13.0-79-powerpc64-emb  3.13.0-79.123
  linux-image-3.13.0-79-powerpc64-smp  3.13.0-79.123

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.
Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages
(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,
linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform
this as well.

possibly gain administrative privileges. (CVE-2015-8543)

Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the pptp implementation in the Linux kernel
did not verify an address length when setting up a socket. A local attacker
could use this to craft an application that exposed sensitive information
from kernel memory. (CVE-2015-8569)

David Miller discovered that the Bluetooth implementation in the Linux
kernel did not properly validate the socket address length for Synchronous
Connection-Oriented (SCO) sockets. A local attacker could use this to
expose sensitive information. (CVE-2015-8575)

It was discovered that the Linux kernel's Filesystem in Userspace (FUSE)
implementation did not handle initial zero length segments properly. A
local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (unkillable
task). (CVE-2015-8785)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 14.04 LTS:
  linux-image-3.19.0-51-generic   3.19.0-51.57~14.04.1
  linux-image-3.19.0-51-generic-lpae  3.19.0-51.57~14.04.1
  linux-image-3.19.0-51-lowlatency  3.19.0-51.57~14.04.1
  linux-image-3.19.0-51-powerpc-e500mc  3.19.0-51.57~14.04.1
  linux-image-3.19.0-51-powerpc-smp  3.19.0-51.57~14.04.1
  linux-image-3.19.0-51-powerpc64-emb  3.19.0-51.57~14.04.1
  linux-image-3.19.0-51-powerpc64-smp  3.19.0-51.57~14.04.1

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.
Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages
(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,
linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform
this as well.

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 15.10:
  linux-image-4.2.0-30-generic    4.2.0-30.36
  linux-image-4.2.0-30-generic-lpae  4.2.0-30.36
  linux-image-4.2.0-30-lowlatency  4.2.0-30.36
  linux-image-4.2.0-30-powerpc-e500mc  4.2.0-30.36
  linux-image-4.2.0-30-powerpc-smp  4.2.0-30.36

Subject: [USN-2908-5] Linux kernel (Wily HWE) regression
Message-ID: <20160227085222.GR19219@nxnw.org>

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-2908-5
February 27, 2016

linux-lts-wily regression
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

Summary:

USN-2908-2 introduced a regression in the Ubuntu 15.10 Linux kernel
backported to Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.

Software Description:
- linux-lts-wily: Linux hardware enablement kernel from Wily for Trusty

Details:

USN-2908-2 fixed vulnerabilities in the Ubuntu 15.10 Linux kernel
backported to Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. An incorrect locking fix caused a
regression that broke graphics displays for Ubuntu 14.04 LTS guests
running the Ubuntu 15.10 backport kernel within VMWare virtual
machines. This update fixes the problem.

We apologize for the inconvenience.
