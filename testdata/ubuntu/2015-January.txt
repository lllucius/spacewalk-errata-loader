==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-2455-1
January 07, 2015

bsd-mailx vulnerability
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 14.10
- Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

Summary:

bsd-mailx could be made to run programs if it parsed a specially crafted
email address.

Software Description:
- bsd-mailx: simple mail user agent

Details:

It was discovered that bsd-mailx contained a feature that allowed
syntactically valid email addresses to be treated as shell commands. A
remote attacker could possibly use this issue with a valid email address to
execute arbitrary commands.

This functionality has now been disabled by default, and can be re-enabled
with the "expandaddr" configuration option. This update alone does not
remove all possibilities of command execution. In environments where
scripts use mailx to process arbitrary email addresses, it is recommended
to modify them to use a "--" separator before the address to properly
handle those that begin with "-".

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 14.10:
  bsd-mailx                       8.1.2-0.20131005cvs-1ubuntu0.14.10.1

Ubuntu 14.04 LTS:
  bsd-mailx                       8.1.2-0.20131005cvs-1ubuntu0.14.04.1

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:
  bsd-mailx                       8.1.2-0.20111106cvs-1ubuntu0.1

Subject: [USN-2461-3] PyYAML vulnerability
Message-ID: <20150112222800.GD5907@nxnw.org>

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-2461-3
January 12, 2015

pyyaml vulnerability
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 14.10
- Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

Summary:

Applications using PyYAML could be made to crash if they received
specially crafted input.

Software Description:
- pyyaml: YAML parser and emitter for Python

Details:

Stanis?aw Pitucha and Jonathan Gray discovered that PyYAML did not
properly handle wrapped strings. An attacker could create specially
crafted YAML data to trigger an assert, causing a denial of service.

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 14.10:
  python-yaml                     3.11-1ubuntu0.1
  python3-yaml                    3.11-1ubuntu0.1

Ubuntu 14.04 LTS:
  python-yaml                     3.10-4ubuntu0.1
  python3-yaml                    3.10-4ubuntu0.1

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:
  python-yaml                     3.10-2ubuntu0.1
  python3-yaml                    3.10-2ubuntu0.1

After a standard system update you need to restart applications using
PyYAML to make all the necessary changes.

Ubuntu Security Notice USN-2462-1
January 13, 2015

linux vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

Software Description:
- linux: Linux kernel

Details:

Lars Bull reported a race condition in the PIT (programmable interrupt
timer) emulation in the KVM (Kernel Virtual Machine) subsystem of the Linux
kernel. A local guest user with access to PIT i/o ports could exploit this
flaw to cause a denial of service (crash) on the host. (CVE-2014-3611)

Lars Bull and Nadav Amit reported a flaw in how KVM (the Kernel Virtual
Machine) handles noncanonical writes to certain MSR registers. A privileged
guest user can exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (kernel
panic) on the host. (CVE-2014-3610)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS:
  linux-image-2.6.32-71-386       2.6.32-71.138
  linux-image-2.6.32-71-generic   2.6.32-71.138
  linux-image-2.6.32-71-generic-pae  2.6.32-71.138
  linux-image-2.6.32-71-ia64      2.6.32-71.138
  linux-image-2.6.32-71-lpia      2.6.32-71.138
  linux-image-2.6.32-71-powerpc   2.6.32-71.138
  linux-image-2.6.32-71-powerpc-smp  2.6.32-71.138
  linux-image-2.6.32-71-powerpc64-smp  2.6.32-71.138
  linux-image-2.6.32-71-preempt   2.6.32-71.138
  linux-image-2.6.32-71-server    2.6.32-71.138
  linux-image-2.6.32-71-sparc64   2.6.32-71.138
  linux-image-2.6.32-71-sparc64-smp  2.6.32-71.138
  linux-image-2.6.32-71-versatile  2.6.32-71.138
  linux-image-2.6.32-71-virtual   2.6.32-71.138

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

Software Description:
- linux: Linux kernel

Details:

A race condition with MMIO and PIO transactions in the KVM (Kernel Virtual
Machine) subsystem of the Linux kernel was discovered. A guest OS user
could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (guest OS crash) via a
specially crafted application. (CVE-2014-7842)

The KVM (kernel virtual machine) subsystem of the Linux kernel
miscalculates the number of memory pages during the handling of a mapping
failure. A guest OS user could exploit this to cause a denial of service
(host OS page unpinning) or possibly have unspecified other impact by
leveraging guest OS privileges. (CVE-2014-8369)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:
  linux-image-3.2.0-75-generic    3.2.0-75.110
  linux-image-3.2.0-75-generic-pae  3.2.0-75.110

A stack buffer overflow was discovered in the ioctl command handling for
the Technotrend/Hauppauge USB DEC devices driver. A local user could
exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly
gain privileges. (CVE-2014-8884)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 14.10:
  linux-image-3.16.0-29-generic   3.16.0-29.39
  linux-image-3.16.0-29-generic-lpae  3.16.0-29.39
  linux-image-3.16.0-29-lowlatency  3.16.0-29.39
  linux-image-3.16.0-29-powerpc-e500mc  3.16.0-29.39
  linux-image-3.16.0-29-powerpc-smp  3.16.0-29.39
  linux-image-3.16.0-29-powerpc64-emb  3.16.0-29.39
  linux-image-3.16.0-29-powerpc64-smp  3.16.0-29.39

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

Subject: [USN-2470-1] Git vulnerability
Message-ID: <20150114004751.GB3078@boyd>

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-2470-1
January 14, 2015

git vulnerability
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 14.10
- Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

Summary:

Git could be made to run programs as your login if it received specially
crafted changes from a remote repository.

Software Description:
- git: fast, scalable, distributed revision control system

Details:

Matt Mackall and Augie Fackler discovered that Git incorrectly handled certain
filesystem paths. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to execute
arbitrary code if the Git tree is stored in an HFS+ or NTFS filesystem. The
remote attacker would need write access to a Git repository that the victim
pulls from.

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 14.10:
  git                             1:2.1.0-1ubuntu0.1

Ubuntu 14.04 LTS:
  git                             1:1.9.1-1ubuntu0.1

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:
  git                             1:1.7.9.5-1ubuntu0.1

After a standard system update you need to set the core.protectHFS and/or
core.protectNTFS Git configuration variables to "true" if you store Git trees
in HFS+ and/or NTFS filesystems. If you host Git trees, setting the
core.protectHFS, core.protectNTFS, and receive.fsckObjects Git configuration
variables to "true" will cause your Git server to reject objects containing
malicious paths intended to overwrite the Git metadata.

opened a malicious website.

Software Description:
- firefox: Mozilla Open Source web browser

Details:

Christian Holler, Patrick McManus, Christoph Diehl, Gary Kwong, Jesse
Ruderman, Byron Campen, Terrence Cole, and Nils Ohlmeier discovered
multiple memory safety issues in Firefox. If a user were tricked in to
opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit
these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute
arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox.
(CVE-2014-8634, CVE-2014-8635)

Bobby Holley discovered that some DOM objects with certain properties
can bypass XrayWrappers in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in
to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially
exploit this to bypass security restrictions. (CVE-2014-8636)

Michal Zalewski discovered a use of uninitialized memory when rendering
malformed bitmap images on a canvas element. If a user were tricked in to
opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially
exploit this to steal confidential information. (CVE-2014-8637)
