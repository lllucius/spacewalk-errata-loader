Subject: Ubuntu 14.10 (Utopic Unicorn) reaches End of Life on July 23, 2015
Message-ID: <20150703130054.GJ2603@0c3.net>

Ubuntu announced its 14.10 (Utopic Unicorn) release almost 9 months
ago, on October 23, 2014.  As a non-LTS release, 14.10 has a 9-month
month support cycle and, as such, the support period is now nearing
its end and Ubuntu 14.10 will reach end of life on Thursday, July
23rd.  At that time, Ubuntu Security Notices will no longer include
information or updated packages for Ubuntu 14.10.

The supported upgrade path from Ubuntu 14.10 is via Ubuntu 15.04.
Instructions and caveats for the upgrade may be found at:

https://help.ubuntu.com/community/VividUpgrades

Ubuntu 15.04 continues to be actively supported with security updates
and select high-impact bug fixes.  Announcements of security updates
for Ubuntu releases are sent to the ubuntu-security-announce mailing
list, information about which may be found at:

https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/ubuntu-security-announce

Since its launch in October 2004 Ubuntu has become one of the most
highly regarded Linux distributions with millions of users in homes,
schools, businesses and governments around the world. Ubuntu is Open
Source software, costs nothing to download, and users are free to
customise or alter their software in order to meet their needs.

On behalf of the Ubuntu Release Team,

Adam Conrad

php5 vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 15.04
- Ubuntu 14.10
- Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in PHP.

Software Description:
- php5: HTML-embedded scripting language interpreter

Details:

Neal Poole and Tomas Hoger discovered that PHP incorrectly handled NULL
bytes in file paths. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to
bypass intended restrictions and create or obtain access to sensitive
files. (CVE-2015-3411, CVE-2015-3412, CVE-2015-4025, CVE-2015-4026,
CVE-2015-4598)

Emmanuel Law discovered that the PHP phar extension incorrectly handled
filenames starting with a NULL byte. A remote attacker could use this issue
with a crafted tar archive to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2015-4021)

Max Spelsberg discovered that PHP incorrectly handled the LIST command
when connecting to remote FTP servers. A malicious FTP server could
possibly use this issue to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2015-4022,
CVE-2015-4643)

Shusheng Liu discovered that PHP incorrectly handled certain malformed form
data. A remote attacker could use this issue with crafted form data to
cause CPU consumption, leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2015-4024)

Andrea Palazzo discovered that the PHP Soap client incorrectly validated
data types. A remote attacker could use this issue with crafted serialized
data to possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2015-4147)

Andrea Palazzo discovered that the PHP Soap client incorrectly validated
that the uri property is a string. A remote attacker could use this issue
with crafted serialized data to possibly obtain sensitive information.
(CVE-2015-4148)

Taoguang Chen discovered that PHP incorrectly validated data types in
multiple locations. A remote attacker could possibly use these issues to
obtain sensitive information or cause a denial of service. (CVE-2015-4599,
CVE-2015-4600, CVE-2015-4601, CVE-2015-4602, CVE-2015-4603)

It was discovered that the PHP Fileinfo component incorrectly handled
certain files. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause PHP to
crash, resulting in a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu
15.04. (CVE-2015-4604, CVE-2015-4605)

It was discovered that PHP incorrectly handled table names in
php_pgsql_meta_data. A local attacker could possibly use this issue to
cause PHP to crash, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2015-4644)

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-2660-1
July 07, 2015

linux vulnerability
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

Summary:

The system could be made to expose sensitive information to local
applications.

Software Description:
- linux: Linux kernel

Details:

A race condition was discovered in the Linux kernel's file_handle size
verification. A local user could exploit this flaw to read potentially
sensative memory locations.

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:
  linux-image-3.2.0-87-generic    3.2.0-87.125
  linux-image-3.2.0-87-generic-pae  3.2.0-87.125
  linux-image-3.2.0-87-highbank   3.2.0-87.125
  linux-image-3.2.0-87-omap       3.2.0-87.125
  linux-image-3.2.0-87-powerpc-smp  3.2.0-87.125
  linux-image-3.2.0-87-powerpc64-smp  3.2.0-87.125
  linux-image-3.2.0-87-virtual    3.2.0-87.125

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

nss vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 15.04
- Ubuntu 14.10
- Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in NSS.

Software Description:
- nss: Network Security Service library

Details:

Karthikeyan Bhargavan discovered that NSS incorrectly handled state
transitions for the TLS state machine. If a remote attacker were able to
perform a man-in-the-middle attack, this flaw could be exploited to skip
the ServerKeyExchange message and remove the forward-secrecy property.
(CVE-2015-2721)

Watson Ladd discovered that NSS incorrectly handled Elliptical Curve
Cryptography (ECC) multiplication. A remote attacker could possibly use
this issue to spoof ECDSA signatures. (CVE-2015-2730)

As a security improvement, this update modifies NSS behaviour to reject DH
key sizes below 768 bits, preventing a possible downgrade attack.

This update also refreshes the NSS package to version 3.19.2 which includes
the latest CA certificate bundle.

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following

Ubuntu Security Notice USN-2656-1
July 09, 2015

firefox vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 15.04
- Ubuntu 14.10
- Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

Summary:

Firefox could be made to crash or run programs as your login if it
opened a malicious website.

Software Description:
- firefox: Mozilla Open Source web browser

Details:

Karthikeyan Bhargavan discovered that NSS incorrectly handled state
transitions for the TLS state machine. If a remote attacker were able to
perform a man-in-the-middle attack, this flaw could be exploited to skip
the ServerKeyExchange message and remove the forward-secrecy property.
(CVE-2015-2721)

Looben Yan discovered 2 use-after-free issues when using XMLHttpRequest in
some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially
crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a
denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with
the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2015-2722,
CVE-2015-2733)

Bob Clary, Christian Holler, Bobby Holley, Andrew McCreight, Terrence
Cole, Steve Fink, Mats Palmgren, Wes Kocher, Andreas Pehrson, Tooru
Fujisawa, Andrew Sutherland, and Gary Kwong discovered multiple memory
safety issues in Firefox. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially
crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a
denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with
the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2015-2724,
CVE-2015-2725, CVE-2015-2726)

Armin Razmdjou discovered that opening hyperlinks with specific mouse
and key combinations could allow a Chrome privileged URL to be opened
without context restrictions being preserved. If a user were tricked in to
opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit
this to bypass security restrictions. (CVE-2015-2727)

Paul Bandha discovered a type confusion bug in the Indexed DB Manager. If
a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker
could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via
application crash or execute arbitrary code with the priviliges of the
user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2015-2728)

Holger Fuhrmannek discovered an out-of-bounds read in Web Audio. If a
user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker
could potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive information.
(CVE-2015-2729)

Watson Ladd discovered that NSS incorrectly handled Elliptical Curve
Cryptography (ECC) multiplication. A remote attacker could possibly use
this issue to spoof ECDSA signatures. (CVE-2015-2730)

A use-after-free was discovered when a Content Policy modifies the DOM to
remove a DOM object. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially
crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a
denial of service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the
priviliges of the user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2015-2731)

Ronald Crane discovered multiple security vulnerabilities. If a user were
tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could
potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via application
crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking
Firefox. (CVE-2015-2734, CVE-2015-2735, CVE-2015-2736, CVE-2015-2737,
CVE-2015-2738, CVE-2015-2739, CVE-2015-2740)

David Keeler discovered that key pinning checks can be skipped when an
overridable certificate error occurs. This allows a user to manually
override an error for a fake certificate, but cannot be exploited on its
own. (CVE-2015-2741)

Jonas Jenwald discovered that some internal workers were incorrectly
executed with a high privilege. If a user were tricked in to opening a
specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this in
combination with another security vulnerability, to execute arbitrary code
in a privileged scope. (CVE-2015-2743)

Matthew Green discovered a DHE key processing issue in NSS where a MITM
could force a server to downgrade TLS connections to 512-bit export-grade
cryptography. An attacker could potentially exploit this to impersonate
the server. (CVE-2015-4000)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 15.04:
  firefox                         39.0+build5-0ubuntu0.15.04.1

Ubuntu 14.10:
  firefox                         39.0+build5-0ubuntu0.14.10.1

Ubuntu 14.04 LTS:
  firefox                         39.0+build5-0ubuntu0.14.04.1

After a standard system update you need to restart Firefox to make
all the necessary changes.

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-2675-1

lxc vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 15.04
- Ubuntu 14.10
- Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in LXC.

Software Description:
- lxc: Linux Containers userspace tools

Details:

Roman Fiedler discovered that LXC had a directory traversal flaw when creating
lock files. A local attacker could exploit this flaw to create an arbitrary
file as the root user. (CVE-2015-1331)

Roman Fiedler discovered that LXC incorrectly trusted the container's proc
filesystem to set up AppArmor profile changes and SELinux domain transitions. A
local attacker could exploit this flaw to run programs inside the container
that are not confined by AppArmor or SELinux. (CVE-2015-1334)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 15.04:
  liblxc1                         1.1.2-0ubuntu3.1
  lxc                             1.1.2-0ubuntu3.1

Ubuntu 14.10:
  liblxc1                         1.1.0~alpha2-0ubuntu3.3
  lxc                             1.1.0~alpha2-0ubuntu3.3

Ubuntu 14.04 LTS:
  liblxc1                         1.0.7-0ubuntu0.2
  lxc                             1.0.7-0ubuntu0.2

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes. You
will need to restart your previously running LXC containers in Ubuntu 15.04 due
to bug that causes containers to be stopped on during lxc package installation
(https://launchpad.net/bugs/1476691).

Subject: [USN-2676-1] NBD vulnerabilities
Message-ID: <55AFD126.1050004@canonical.com>

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-2676-1
July 22, 2015

nbd vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 15.04
- Ubuntu 14.10
- Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in NBD.

Software Description:
- nbd: Network Block Device protocol

Details:

It was discovered that NBD incorrectly handled IP address matching. A
remote attacker could use this issue with an IP address that has a partial
match and bypass access restrictions. This issue only affected
Ubuntu 12.04 LTS. (CVE-2013-6410)

Tuomas R?s?nen discovered that NBD incorrectly handled wrong export names
and closed connections during negotiation. A remote attacker could use this
issue to cause NBD to crash, resulting in a denial of service. This issue
only affected Ubuntu 12.04 LTS. (CVE-2013-7441)

Tuomas R?s?nen discovered that NBD incorrectly handled signals. A remote
attacker could use this issue to cause NBD to crash, resulting in a denial
of service. (CVE-2015-0847)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 15.04:
  nbd-server                      1:3.8-4ubuntu0.1

Ubuntu 14.10:
  nbd-server                      1:3.8-1ubuntu0.1

Ubuntu 14.04 LTS:
  nbd-server                      1:3.7-1ubuntu0.1

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:
  nbd-server                      1:2.9.25-2ubuntu1.1

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.

Subject: Ubuntu 14.10 (Utopic Unicorn) End of Life reached on July 23, 2015
Message-ID: <20150723214945.GF396@0c3.net>

This is a follow-up to the End of Life warning sent earlier this
month to confirm that as of today (July 23, 2015), Ubuntu 14.10 is
no longer supported.  No more package updates will be accepted to
14.10, and it will be archived to old-releases.ubuntu.com in the
coming weeks.

The original End of Life warning follows, with upgrade instructions:

Ubuntu announced its 14.10 (Utopic Unicorn) release almost 9 months
ago, on October 23, 2014.  As a non-LTS release, 14.10 has a 9-month
month support cycle and, as such, the support period is now nearing
its end and Ubuntu 14.10 will reach end of life on Thursday, July
23rd.  At that time, Ubuntu Security Notices will no longer include
information or updated packages for Ubuntu 14.10.

The supported upgrade path from Ubuntu 14.10 is via Ubuntu 15.04.
Instructions and caveats for the upgrade may be found at:

https://help.ubuntu.com/community/VividUpgrades

Ubuntu 15.04 continues to be actively supported with security updates
and select high-impact bug fixes.  Announcements of security updates
for Ubuntu releases are sent to the ubuntu-security-announce mailing
list, information about which may be found at:

https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/ubuntu-security-announce

Since its launch in October 2004 Ubuntu has become one of the most
highly regarded Linux distributions with millions of users in homes,
schools, businesses and governments around the world. Ubuntu is Open
Source software, costs nothing to download, and users are free to
customise or alter their software in order to meet their needs.

On behalf of the Ubuntu Release Team,

Adam Conrad

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-2678-1
July 23, 2015

linux vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

Software Description:
- linux: Linux kernel

Details:

A flaw was discovered in the user space memory copying for the pipe iovecs
in the Linux kernel. An unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw to
cause a denial of service (system crash) or potentially escalate their
privileges. (CVE-2015-1805)

Daniel Borkmann reported a kernel crash in the Linux kernel's BPF filter
JIT optimization. A local attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a
denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2015-4700)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:
  linux-image-3.2.0-88-generic    3.2.0-88.126
  linux-image-3.2.0-88-generic-pae  3.2.0-88.126
  linux-image-3.2.0-88-highbank   3.2.0-88.126
  linux-image-3.2.0-88-omap       3.2.0-88.126
  linux-image-3.2.0-88-powerpc-smp  3.2.0-88.126
  linux-image-3.2.0-88-powerpc64-smp  3.2.0-88.126
  linux-image-3.2.0-88-virtual    3.2.0-88.126

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2015-4700)

A flaw was discovered in how the Linux kernel handles invalid UDP
checksums. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of
service using a flood of UDP packets with invalid checksums.
(CVE-2015-5364)

A flaw was discovered in how the Linux kernel handles invalid UDP
checksums. A remote attacker can cause a denial of service against
applications that use epoll by injecting a single packet with an invalid
checksum. (CVE-2015-5366)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 15.04:
  linux-image-3.19.0-23-generic   3.19.0-23.24
  linux-image-3.19.0-23-generic-lpae  3.19.0-23.24
  linux-image-3.19.0-23-lowlatency  3.19.0-23.24
  linux-image-3.19.0-23-powerpc-e500mc  3.19.0-23.24
  linux-image-3.19.0-23-powerpc-smp  3.19.0-23.24
  linux-image-3.19.0-23-powerpc64-emb  3.19.0-23.24
  linux-image-3.19.0-23-powerpc64-smp  3.19.0-23.24

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

qemu vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 15.04
- Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in QEMU.

Software Description:
- qemu: Machine emulator and virtualizer

Details:

Matt Tait discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled PIT emulation. In a
non-default configuration, a malicious guest could use this issue to cause
a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code on the host as the
user running the QEMU process. In the default installation, when QEMU is
used with libvirt, attackers would be isolated by the libvirt AppArmor
profile. (CVE-2015-3214)

Kevin Wolf discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled processing ATAPI
commands. A malicious guest could use this issue to cause a denial of
service, or possibly execute arbitrary code on the host as the user running
the QEMU process. In the default installation, when QEMU is used with
libvirt, attackers would be isolated by the libvirt AppArmor profile.
(CVE-2015-5154)

Zhu Donghai discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled the SCSI driver. A
malicious guest could use this issue to cause a denial of service, or
possibly execute arbitrary code on the host as the user running the QEMU
process. In the default installation, when QEMU is used with libvirt,
attackers would be isolated by the libvirt AppArmor profile. This issue
only affected Ubuntu 15.04. (CVE-2015-5158)

Message-ID: <55BA5C45.6090604@canonical.com>

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-2699-1
July 30, 2015

hplip vulnerability
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 15.04
- Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

Summary:

HPLIP could be tricked into downloading a different GPG key when
performing printer plugin installations.

Software Description:
- hplip: HP Linux Printing and Imaging System (HPLIP)

Details:

Enrico Zini discovered that HPLIP used a short GPG key ID when downloading
keys from the keyserver. An attacker could possibly use this to return a
different key with a duplicate short key id and perform a man-in-the-middle
attack on printer plugin installations.

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 15.04:
  hplip-data                      3.15.2-0ubuntu4.2

Ubuntu 14.04 LTS:
  hplip-data                      3.14.3-0ubuntu3.4

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:
  hplip-data                      3.12.2-1ubuntu3.5

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.

Subject: [USN-2700-1] Linux kernel vulnerabilities
Message-ID: <55BADA0E.5030805@canonical.com>

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-2700-1
July 31, 2015

linux vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

Software Description:
- linux: Linux kernel

Details:

Andy Lutomirski discovered a flaw in the Linux kernel's handling of nested
NMIs (non-maskable interrupts). An unprivileged local user could exploit
this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) or potentially
escalate their privileges. (CVE-2015-3290)

Andy Lutomirski discovered a flaw that allows user to cause the Linux
kernel to ignore some NMIs (non-maskable interrupts). A local unprivileged
user could exploit this flaw to potentially cause the system to miss
important NMIs resulting in unspecified effects. (CVE-2015-3291)

Andy Lutomirski and Petr Matousek discovered that an NMI (non-maskable
interrupt) that interrupts userspace and encounters an IRET fault is
incorrectly handled by the Linux kernel. An unprivileged local user could
exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (kernel OOPs), corruption,
or potentially escalate privileges on the system. (CVE-2015-5157)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 14.04 LTS:
  linux-image-3.13.0-61-generic   3.13.0-61.100
  linux-image-3.13.0-61-generic-lpae  3.13.0-61.100
  linux-image-3.13.0-61-lowlatency  3.13.0-61.100
  linux-image-3.13.0-61-powerpc-e500  3.13.0-61.100
  linux-image-3.13.0-61-powerpc-e500mc  3.13.0-61.100
  linux-image-3.13.0-61-powerpc-smp  3.13.0-61.100
  linux-image-3.13.0-61-powerpc64-emb  3.13.0-61.100
  linux-image-3.13.0-61-powerpc64-smp  3.13.0-61.100

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.
