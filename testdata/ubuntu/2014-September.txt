Ubuntu Security Notice USN-2331-1
September 02, 2014

libreoffice vulnerability
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

Summary:

LibreOffice Calc could be made to crash or run programs as your login if it
opened a specially crafted file.

Software Description:
- libreoffice: Office productivity suite

Details:

Rohan Durve and James Kettle discovered LibreOffice Calc sometimes allowed
for command injection when opening spreadsheets. If a user were tricked
into opening a crafted Calc spreadsheet, an attacker could exploit this to
run programs as your login.

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 14.04 LTS:
  libreoffice-core                1:4.2.6.3-0ubuntu1

After a standard system update you need to restart LibreOffice to make
all the necessary changes.

Ubuntu Security Notice USN-2332-1
September 02, 2014

linux vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

Software Description:
- linux: Linux kernel

Details:

A bug was discovered in the handling of pathname components when used with
an autofs direct mount. A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a
denial of service (system crash) via an open system call. (CVE-2014-0203)

Toralf F?rster reported an error in the Linux kernels syscall auditing on
32 bit x86 platforms. A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a
denial of service (OOPS and system crash). (CVE-2014-4508)

An information leak was discovered in the control implemenation of the
Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) subsystem in the Linux kernel. A
local user could exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive information from
kernel memory. (CVE-2014-4652)

A use-after-free flaw was discovered in the Advanced Linux Sound
Architecture (ALSA) control implementation of the Linux kernel. A local
user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash).
(CVE-2014-4653)

A authorization bug was discovered with the snd_ctl_elem_add function of
the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) in the Linux kernel. A local
user could exploit his bug to cause a denial of service (remove kernel
controls). (CVE-2014-4654)

A flaw discovered in how the snd_ctl_elem function of the Advanced Linux
Sound Architecture (ALSA) handled a reference count. A local user could
exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (integer overflow and limit
bypass). (CVE-2014-4655)

An integer overflow flaw was discovered in the control implementation of
the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA). A local user could exploit
this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2014-4656)

An integer underflow flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's handling of
the backlog value for certain SCTP packets. A remote attacker could exploit
this flaw to cause a denial of service (socket outage) via a crafted SCTP
packet. (CVE-2014-4667)

Jason Gunthorpe reported a flaw with SCTP authentication in the Linux
kernel. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of
service (NULL pointer dereference and OOPS). (CVE-2014-5077)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS:
  linux-image-2.6.32-65-386       2.6.32-65.131
  linux-image-2.6.32-65-generic   2.6.32-65.131
  linux-image-2.6.32-65-generic-pae  2.6.32-65.131
  linux-image-2.6.32-65-ia64      2.6.32-65.131
  linux-image-2.6.32-65-lpia      2.6.32-65.131
  linux-image-2.6.32-65-powerpc   2.6.32-65.131
  linux-image-2.6.32-65-powerpc-smp  2.6.32-65.131
  linux-image-2.6.32-65-powerpc64-smp  2.6.32-65.131
  linux-image-2.6.32-65-preempt   2.6.32-65.131
  linux-image-2.6.32-65-server    2.6.32-65.131
  linux-image-2.6.32-65-sparc64   2.6.32-65.131
  linux-image-2.6.32-65-sparc64-smp  2.6.32-65.131
  linux-image-2.6.32-65-versatile  2.6.32-65.131
  linux-image-2.6.32-65-virtual   2.6.32-65.131

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

bypass). (CVE-2014-4655)

An integer overflow flaw was discovered in the control implementation of
the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA). A local user could exploit
this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2014-4656)

An integer underflow flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's handling of
the backlog value for certain SCTP packets. A remote attacker could exploit
this flaw to cause a denial of service (socket outage) via a crafted SCTP
packet. (CVE-2014-4667)

Vasily Averin discover a reference count flaw during attempts to umount in
conjunction with a symlink. A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a
denial of service (memory consumption or use after free) or possibly have
other unspecified impact. (CVE-2014-5045)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:
  linux-image-3.13.0-35-generic   3.13.0-35.62~precise1
  linux-image-3.13.0-35-generic-lpae  3.13.0-35.62~precise1

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

Software Description:
- linux: Linux kernel

Details:

Chris Evans reported an flaw in the Linux kernel's handling of iso9660
(compact disk filesystem) images. An attacker who can mount a custom
iso9660 image either via a CD/DVD drive or a loopback mount could cause a
denial of service (system crash or reboot). (CVE-2014-5471)

Chris Evans reported an flaw in the Linux kernel's handling of iso9660
(compact disk filesystem) images. An attacker who can mount a custom
iso9660 image, with a self-referential CL entry, either via a CD/DVD drive
or a loopback mount could cause a denial of service (unkillable mount
process). (CVE-2014-5472)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS:
  linux-image-2.6.32-66-386       2.6.32-66.132
  linux-image-2.6.32-66-generic   2.6.32-66.132

  linux-image-2.6.32-66-powerpc   2.6.32-66.132
  linux-image-2.6.32-66-powerpc-smp  2.6.32-66.132
  linux-image-2.6.32-66-powerpc64-smp  2.6.32-66.132
  linux-image-2.6.32-66-preempt   2.6.32-66.132
  linux-image-2.6.32-66-server    2.6.32-66.132
  linux-image-2.6.32-66-sparc64   2.6.32-66.132
  linux-image-2.6.32-66-sparc64-smp  2.6.32-66.132
  linux-image-2.6.32-66-versatile  2.6.32-66.132
  linux-image-2.6.32-66-virtual   2.6.32-66.132

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

Chris Evans reported an flaw in the Linux kernel's handling of iso9660
(compact disk filesystem) images. An attacker who can mount a custom
iso9660 image, with a self-referential CL entry, either via a CD/DVD drive
or a loopback mount could cause a denial of service (unkillable mount
process). (CVE-2014-5472)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS:
  linux-image-2.6.32-370-ec2      2.6.32-370.86

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

Summary:

Fraudulent security certificates could allow sensitive information to
be exposed when accessing the Internet.

Software Description:

Details:

Antoine Delignat-Lavaud and others discovered that NSS incorrectly handled
parsing ASN.1 values. An attacker could use this issue to forge RSA
certificates.

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 14.04 LTS:
  libnss3                         2:3.17.1-0ubuntu0.14.04.1

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:
  libnss3                         3.17.1-0ubuntu0.12.04.1

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS:
  libnss3-1d                      3.17.1-0ubuntu0.10.04.1

This update uses a new upstream release, which includes additional bug
fixes. After a standard system update you need to restart any applications
that use NSS, such as Evolution and Chromium, to make all the necessary
changes.
