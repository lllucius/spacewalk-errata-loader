Subject: [USN-2733-1] Linux kernel (Trusty HWE) vulnerability

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-2733-1
September 03, 2015

linux-lts-trusty vulnerability
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

Summary:

The system could be made to crash or run programs as an administrator.

Software Description:
- linux-lts-trusty: Linux hardware enablement kernel from Trusty

Details:

It was discovered that an integer overflow error existed in the SCSI
generic (sg) driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker with write
permission to a SCSI generic device could use this to cause a denial of
service (system crash) or potentially escalate their privileges.

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:
  linux-image-3.13.0-63-generic   3.13.0-63.104~precise1
  linux-image-3.13.0-63-generic-lpae  3.13.0-63.104~precise1

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

Subject: [USN-2737-1] Linux kernel (Vivid HWE) vulnerability
Message-ID: <20150909063256.GK30355@nxnw.org>

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-2737-1
September 09, 2015

linux-lts-vivid vulnerability
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

Summary:

The system could be made to crash or run programs as an administrator.

Software Description:
- linux-lts-vivid: Linux hardware enablement kernel from Vivid

Details:

It was discovered that an integer overflow error existed in the SCSI
generic (sg) driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker with write
permission to a SCSI generic device could use this to cause a denial of
service (system crash) or potentially escalate their privileges.

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 14.04 LTS:
  linux-image-3.19.0-28-generic   3.19.0-28.30~14.04.1
  linux-image-3.19.0-28-generic-lpae  3.19.0-28.30~14.04.1
  linux-image-3.19.0-28-lowlatency  3.19.0-28.30~14.04.1
  linux-image-3.19.0-28-powerpc-e500mc  3.19.0-28.30~14.04.1
  linux-image-3.19.0-28-powerpc-smp  3.19.0-28.30~14.04.1
  linux-image-3.19.0-28-powerpc64-emb  3.19.0-28.30~14.04.1
  linux-image-3.19.0-28-powerpc64-smp  3.19.0-28.30~14.04.1

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

Message-ID: <560425D8.1010609@canonical.com>

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-2743-3
September 24, 2015

unity-firefox-extension, webapps-greasemonkey, webaccounts-browser-extension update
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 15.04
- Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

Summary:

This update provides compatible packages for Firefox 41

Software Description:
- unity-firefox-extension: Unity Integration for Firefox
- webaccounts-browser-extension: Ubuntu Online Accounts extension for chromium
- webapps-greasemonkey: Firefox extension: Website Integration

Details:

USN-2743-1 fixed vulnerabilities in Firefox. Future Firefox updates will
require all addons be signed and unity-firefox-extension, webapps-greasemonkey
and webaccounts-browser-extension will not go through the signing process.
Because these addons currently break search engine installations (LP:
#1069793), this update permanently disables the addons by removing them from
the system.

We apologize for any inconvenience.

issue to cause the QEMU process to hang, resulting in a denial of service.
(CVE-2015-5278)

Qinghao Tang discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled receiving certain
packets in the NE2000 network driver. A malicious guest could use this
issue to cause a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code on
the host as the user running the QEMU process. In the default installation,
when QEMU is used with libvirt, attackers would be isolated by the libvirt
AppArmor profile. (CVE-2015-5279)

Qinghao Tang discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled transmit descriptor
data when sending network packets. A malicious guest could use this issue
to cause the QEMU process to hang, resulting in a denial of service.

Message-ID: <20150928203017.GB9470@nxnw.org>

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-2748-1
September 28, 2015

linux vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

Software Description:
- linux: Linux kernel

Details:

Benjamin Randazzo discovered an information leak in the md (multiple
device) driver when the bitmap_info.file is disabled. A local privileged
attacker could use this to obtain sensitive information from the kernel.
(CVE-2015-5697)

Marc-Andr? Lureau discovered that the vhost driver did not properly
release the userspace provided log file descriptor. A privileged attacker
could use this to cause a denial of service (resource exhaustion).
(CVE-2015-6252)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 14.04 LTS:
  linux-image-3.13.0-65-generic   3.13.0-65.105
  linux-image-3.13.0-65-generic-lpae  3.13.0-65.105
  linux-image-3.13.0-65-lowlatency  3.13.0-65.105
  linux-image-3.13.0-65-powerpc-e500  3.13.0-65.105
  linux-image-3.13.0-65-powerpc-e500mc  3.13.0-65.105
  linux-image-3.13.0-65-powerpc-smp  3.13.0-65.105
  linux-image-3.13.0-65-powerpc64-emb  3.13.0-65.105
  linux-image-3.13.0-65-powerpc64-smp  3.13.0-65.105

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

Subject: [USN-2753-2] LXC regression
Message-ID: <20150930182349.GA26071@boyd>

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-2753-2
September 30, 2015

lxc regression
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

Summary:

USN-2753-1 introduced a regression in LXC.

Software Description:
- lxc: Linux Containers userspace tools

Details:

USN-2753-1 fixed a vulnerability in LXC. The update caused a regression that
prevented some containers from starting. This regression only affected
containers that had an absolute path specified as a bind mount target in their
configuration file. This update fixes the problem.

We apologize for the inconvenience.

Original advisory details:

 Roman Fiedler discovered a directory traversal flaw in lxc-start. A local
 attacker with access to an LXC container could exploit this flaw to run
 programs inside the container that are not confined by AppArmor or expose
 unintended files in the host to the container.

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 14.04 LTS:
  lxc                             1.0.7-0ubuntu0.6

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.
