Bernd Melchers discovered that PHP's embedded libmagic library incorrectly
handled indirect offset values. An attacker could use this issue to cause
PHP to consume resources or crash, resulting in a denial of service.
(CVE-2014-1943)

It was discovered that PHP incorrectly handled certain values when using
the imagecrop function. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause
PHP to crash, resulting in a denial of service, obtain sensitive
information, or possibly execute arbitrary code. This issue only affected
Ubuntu 13.10. (CVE-2013-7226, CVE-2013-7327, CVE-2013-7328, CVE-2014-2020)

Ubuntu Security Notice USN-2128-1
March 05, 2014

linux vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

Software Description:
- linux: Linux kernel

Details:

An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel when inotify is used
to monitor the /dev/ptmx device. A local user could exploit this flaw to
discover keystroke timing and potentially discover sensitive information
like password length. (CVE-2013-0160)

Vasily Kulikov reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's implementation of
ptrace. An unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw to obtain
sensitive information from kernel memory. (CVE-2013-2929)

function of the Kernel Virtual Machine (KVM) subsystem. A local user could
exploit this flaw to gain privileges on the host machine. (CVE-2013-4587)

Andrew Honig reported a flaw in the apic_get_tmcct function of the Kernel
Virtual Machine (KVM) subsystem if the Linux kernel. A guest OS user could
exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service or host OS system crash.
(CVE-2013-6367)

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported a flaw in the driver for Adaptec
AACRAID scsi raid devices in the Linux kernel. A local user could use this
flaw to cause a denial of service or possibly other unspecified impact.
(CVE-2013-6380)

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported buffer underflow errors in the
implementation of the XFS filesystem in the Linux kernel. A local user with
CAP_SYS_ADMIN could exploit these flaw to cause a denial of service (memory
corruption) or possibly other unspecified issues. (CVE-2013-6382)

Evan Huus reported a buffer overflow in the Linux kernel's radiotap header
parsing. A remote attacker could cause a denial of service (buffer over-
read) via a specially crafted header. (CVE-2013-7027)

An information leak was discovered in the recvfrom, recvmmsg, and recvmsg
systemcalls when used with ISDN sockets in the Linux kernel. A local user
could exploit this leak to obtain potentially sensitive information from
kernel memory. (CVE-2013-7266)

An information leak was discovered in the recvfrom, recvmmsg, and recvmsg
systemcalls when used with apple talk sockets in the Linux kernel. A local
user could exploit this leak to obtain potentially sensitive information
from kernel memory. (CVE-2013-7267)

systemcalls when used with ipx protocol sockets in the Linux kernel. A
local user could exploit this leak to obtain potentially sensitive
information from kernel memory. (CVE-2013-7268)

An information leak was discovered in the recvfrom, recvmmsg, and recvmsg
systemcalls when used with the netrom address family in the Linux kernel. A
local user could exploit this leak to obtain potentially sensitive
information from kernel memory. (CVE-2013-7269)

An information leak was discovered in the recvfrom, recvmmsg, and recvmsg
systemcalls when used with packet address family sockets in the Linux
kernel. A local user could exploit this leak to obtain potentially
sensitive information from kernel memory. (CVE-2013-7270)

An information leak was discovered in the recvfrom, recvmmsg, and recvmsg
systemcalls when used with x25 protocol sockets in the Linux kernel. A
local user could exploit this leak to obtain potentially sensitive
information from kernel memory. (CVE-2013-7271)

An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel's SIOCWANDEV ioctl
call. A local user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability could exploit this
flaw to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory.
(CVE-2014-1444)

An information leak was discovered in the wanxl ioctl function the
Linux kernel. A local user could exploit this flaw to obtain potentially
sensitive information from kernel memory. (CVE-2014-1445)

An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel's hamradio YAM
driver for AX.25 packet radio. A local user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN
capability could exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive information from
kernel memory. (CVE-2014-1446)

Matthew Thode reported a denial of service vulnerability in the Linux
kernel when SELinux support is enabled. A local user with the CAP_MAC_ADMIN
capability (and the SELinux mac_admin permission if running in enforcing
mode) could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (kernel crash).
(CVE-2014-1874)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS:
  linux-image-2.6.32-57-386       2.6.32-57.119
  linux-image-2.6.32-57-generic   2.6.32-57.119
  linux-image-2.6.32-57-generic-pae  2.6.32-57.119
  linux-image-2.6.32-57-ia64      2.6.32-57.119
  linux-image-2.6.32-57-lpia      2.6.32-57.119
  linux-image-2.6.32-57-powerpc   2.6.32-57.119
  linux-image-2.6.32-57-powerpc-smp  2.6.32-57.119
  linux-image-2.6.32-57-powerpc64-smp  2.6.32-57.119
  linux-image-2.6.32-57-preempt   2.6.32-57.119
  linux-image-2.6.32-57-server    2.6.32-57.119
  linux-image-2.6.32-57-sparc64   2.6.32-57.119
  linux-image-2.6.32-57-sparc64-smp  2.6.32-57.119
  linux-image-2.6.32-57-versatile  2.6.32-57.119
  linux-image-2.6.32-57-virtual   2.6.32-57.119

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

Ubuntu Security Notice USN-2133-1
March 07, 2014

linux vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

Software Description:
- linux: Linux kernel

Details:

Mathy Vanhoef discovered an error in the the way the ath9k driver was
handling the BSSID masking. A remote attacker could exploit this error to
discover the original MAC address after a spoofing atack. (CVE-2013-4579)

Andrew Honig reported an error in the Linux Kernel's Kernel Virtual Machine
(KVM) VAPIC synchronization operation. A local user could exploit this flaw
to gain privileges or cause a denial of service (system crash).
(CVE-2013-6368)

halfdog reported an error in the AMD K7 and K8 platform support in the
Linux kernel. An unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw on AMD
based systems to cause a denial of service (task kill) or possibly gain
privileges via a crafted application. (CVE-2014-1438)

An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel's hamradio YAM
driver for AX.25 packet radio. A local user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN
capability could exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive information from
kernel memory. (CVE-2014-1446)

Matthew Thode reported a denial of service vulnerability in the Linux
kernel when SELinux support is enabled. A local user with the CAP_MAC_ADMIN
capability (and the SELinux mac_admin permission if running in enforcing
mode) could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (kernel crash).
(CVE-2014-1874)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:
  linux-image-3.2.0-60-generic    3.2.0-60.91
  linux-image-3.2.0-60-generic-pae  3.2.0-60.91
  linux-image-3.2.0-60-highbank   3.2.0-60.91
  linux-image-3.2.0-60-omap       3.2.0-60.91
  linux-image-3.2.0-60-powerpc-smp  3.2.0-60.91
  linux-image-3.2.0-60-powerpc64-smp  3.2.0-60.91
  linux-image-3.2.0-60-virtual    3.2.0-60.91

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:
  linux-image-3.8.0-37-generic    3.8.0-37.53~precise1

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

Details:

An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel when built with the
NetFilter Connection Tracking (NF_CONNTRACK) support for IRC protocol
(NF_NAT_IRC). A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to obtain
potentially sensitive kernel information when communicating over a client-
to-client IRC connection(/dcc) via a NAT-ed network. (CVE-2014-1690)

Matthew Thode reported a denial of service vulnerability in the Linux
kernel when SELinux support is enabled. A local user with the CAP_MAC_ADMIN
capability (and the SELinux mac_admin permission if running in enforcing
mode) could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (kernel crash).
(CVE-2014-1874)

An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel's NFS filesystem. A
local users with write access to an NFS share could exploit this flaw to
obtain potential sensative information from kernel memory. (CVE-2014-2038)

(CVE-2014-1874)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 13.10:
  linux-image-3.5.0-239-omap4     3.5.0-239.55

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 13.10
- Ubuntu 12.10
- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in Sudo.

Software Description:
- sudo: Provide limited super user privileges to specific users

Details:

Sebastien Macke discovered that Sudo incorrectly handled blacklisted
environment variables when the env_reset option was disabled. A local
attacker could use this issue to possibly run unintended commands by using
blacklisted environment variables. In a default Ubuntu installation, the
env_reset option is enabled by default. This issue only affected Ubuntu
10.04 LTS and Ubuntu 12.04 LTS. (CVE-2014-0106)

It was discovered that the Sudo init script set a date in the past on
existing timestamp files instead of using epoch to invalidate them
completely. A local attacker could possibly modify the system time to
attempt to reuse timestamp files. This issue only applied to Ubuntu
12.04 LTS, Ubuntu 12.10 and Ubuntu 13.10. (LP: #1223297)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 13.10:
  sudo                            1.8.6p3-0ubuntu3.1

clamav update
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 13.10
- Ubuntu 12.10
- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

Summary:

ClamAV has been updated to a new version.

Software Description:
- clamav: Anti-virus utility for Unix

Details:

This updates ClamAV to a new major version in order to gain new detection
technologies and maintain proper compatibility with the virus signature
database.

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 13.10:
  clamav                          0.98.1+dfsg-4ubuntu1~ubuntu13.10.2

Ubuntu 12.10:
  clamav                          0.98.1+dfsg-4ubuntu1~ubuntu12.10.2

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:
  clamav                          0.98.1+dfsg-4ubuntu1~ubuntu12.04.2

This update uses a new upstream release, which includes additional bug
fixes. In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary
changes.
