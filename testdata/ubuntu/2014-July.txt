Subject: [USN-2265-1] NSPR vulnerability
Message-ID: <53B4564D.6090706@canonical.com>

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-2265-1
July 02, 2014

nspr vulnerability
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 13.10
- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

Summary:

NSPR could be made to crash or run programs if it received specially
crafted input.

Software Description:
- nspr: NetScape Portable Runtime Library

Details:

Abhishek Arya discovered that NSPR incorrectly handled certain console
functions. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause NSPR to crash,
resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. The
default compiler options for affected releases should reduce the
vulnerability to a denial of service.

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 14.04 LTS:
  libnspr4                        2:4.10.2-1ubuntu1.1

Ubuntu 13.10:
  libnspr4                        2:4.9.5-1ubuntu1.2

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:
  libnspr4                        4.9.5-0ubuntu0.12.04.3

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS:
  libnspr4-0d                     4.9.5-0ubuntu0.10.04.3

After a standard system update you need to restart your session to make all
the necessary changes.

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

Subject: 12.04.x HWE Stack EOL Notification
Message-ID: <CAAE8-rKyJOjZoy3cU0u1zxZ8ehEcRzKXthJYLjwsgtYeWEHdRA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

In an effort to support a wider variety of hardware within the 12.04 Ubuntu
LTS release, the 12.04.2 and newer point releases in Precise shipped with
hardware enablement stacks composed of updated kernels and graphics stacks.
 The intention has always been for these hardware enablement stacks to only
remain supported until the introduction of the kernel and graphics stack
derived from 14.04.  On August 7, 2014, the 5th and final point release for
12.04 (ie. 12.04.5) will deliver the kernel and graphics stack derived from
14.04.  At that time, security updates and bug fixes for older hardware
enablement stacks will no longer be provided.  All users of older hardware
enablement stacks will be encouraged to update to the 12.04.5 hardware
enablement stack or fully upgrade to 14.04 proper.  For any 12.04 HWE stack
users interested in making this migration prior to the August 7, 2014
deadline, we have provided a mechanism to assist with this process.  First,
please ensure your system is up to date with the latest package updates for
Precise.  Then, run the command below and follow the instructions which are
output:

hwe-support-status --verbose

For further information and details, please see:
https://wiki.ubuntu.com/1204_HWE_EOL

Thanks,
Leann Ogasawara

Message-ID: <53C57533.50107@canonical.com>

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-2277-1
July 15, 2014

libav vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 13.10
- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

Summary:

Libav could be made to crash or run programs as your login if it opened a
specially crafted file.

Software Description:
- libav: Multimedia player, server, encoder and transcoder

Details:

It was discovered that Libav incorrectly handled certain malformed media
files. If a user were tricked into opening a crafted media file, an
attacker could cause a denial of service via application crash, or possibly
execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the
program.

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 13.10:
  libavcodec53                    6:0.8.13-0ubuntu0.13.10.1
  libavformat53                   6:0.8.13-0ubuntu0.13.10.1

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:
  libavcodec53                    4:0.8.13-0ubuntu0.12.04.1
  libavformat53                   4:0.8.13-0ubuntu0.12.04.1

This update uses a new upstream release, which includes additional bug
fixes. In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary
changes.

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-2281-1
July 16, 2014

linux-ec2 vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

Software Description:
- linux-ec2: Linux kernel for EC2

Details:

Sasha Levin reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's point-to-point protocol
(PPP) when used with the Layer Two Tunneling Protocol (L2TP). A local user
could exploit this flaw to gain administrative privileges. (CVE-2014-4943)

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's audit subsystem when auditing
certain syscalls. A local attacker could exploit this flaw to obtain
potentially sensitive single-bit values from kernel memory or cause a
denial of service (OOPS). (CVE-2014-3917)

Don Bailey discovered a flaw in the LZO decompress algorithm used by the
Linux kernel. An attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of
service (memory corruption or OOPS). (CVE-2014-4608)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS:
  linux-image-2.6.32-368-ec2      2.6.32-368.84

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

Subject: [USN-2284-1] Linux kernel (OMAP4) vulnerabilities
Message-ID: <53C72E4C.3090107@canonical.com>

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-2284-1
July 16, 2014

linux-ti-omap4 vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

Software Description:
- linux-ti-omap4: Linux kernel for OMAP4

Details:

Sasha Levin reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's point-to-point protocol
(PPP) when used with the Layer Two Tunneling Protocol (L2TP). A local user
could exploit this flaw to gain administrative privileges. (CVE-2014-4943)

Michael S. Tsirkin discovered an information leak in the Linux kernel's
segmentation of skbs when using the zerocopy feature of vhost-net. A local
attacker could exploit this flaw to gain potentially sensitive information
from kernel memory. (CVE-2014-0131)

Don Bailey discovered a flaw in the LZO decompress algorithm used by the
Linux kernel. An attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of
service (memory corruption or OOPS). (CVE-2014-4608)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:
  linux-image-3.2.0-1451-omap4    3.2.0-1451.71

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

segmentation of skbs when using the zerocopy feature of vhost-net. A local
attacker could exploit this flaw to gain potentially sensitive information
from kernel memory. (CVE-2014-0131)

Salva Peir? discovered an information leak in the Linux kernel's media-
device driver. A local attacker could exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive
information from kernel memory. (CVE-2014-1739)

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's audit subsystem when auditing
certain syscalls. A local attacker could exploit this flaw to obtain
potentially sensitive single-bit values from kernel memory or cause a
denial of service (OOPS). (CVE-2014-3917)

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's implementation of user
namespaces with respect to inode permissions. A local user could exploit
this flaw by creating a user namespace to gain administrative privileges.
(CVE-2014-4014)

An information leak was discovered in the rd_mcp backend of the iSCSI
target subsystem in the Linux kernel. A local user could exploit this flaw
to obtain sensitive information from ramdisk_mcp memory by leveraging
access to a SCSI initiator. (CVE-2014-4027)

Don Bailey discovered a flaw in the LZO decompress algorithm used by the
Linux kernel. An attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of
service (memory corruption or OOPS). (CVE-2014-4608)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:
  linux-image-3.5.0-54-generic    3.5.0-54.81~precise1

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

Subject: Ubuntu 13.10 (Saucy Salamander) End of Life reached on July 17 2014
Message-ID: <20140717161936.GP28005@0c3.net>

This is a follow-up to the End of Life warning sent last month to
confirm that as of today (July 17, 2014), Ubuntu 13.10 is no longer
supported.  No more package updates will be accepted to 13.10, and
it will be archived to old-releases.ubuntu.com in the coming weeks.

The original End of Life warning follows, with upgrade instructions:

Ubuntu announced its 13.10 (Saucy Salamander) release almost 9 months
ago, on October 17, 2013.  This was the second release with our new 9
month support cycle and, as such, the support period is now nearing
its end and Ubuntu 13.10 will reach end of life on Thursday, July
17th.  At that time, Ubuntu Security Notices will no longer include
information or updated packages for Ubuntu 13.10.

The supported upgrade path from Ubuntu 13.10 is via Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.
Instructions and caveats for the upgrade may be found at:

https://help.ubuntu.com/community/TrustyUpgrades

Ubuntu 14.04 LTS continues to be actively supported with security
updates and select high-impact bug fixes.  Announcements of security
updates for Ubuntu releases are sent to the ubuntu-security-announce
mailing list, information about which may be found at:

https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/ubuntu-security-announce

Since its launch in October 2004 Ubuntu has become one of the most
highly regarded Linux distributions with millions of users in homes,
schools, businesses and governments around the world. Ubuntu is Open
Source software, costs nothing to download, and users are free to
customise or alter their software in order to meet their needs.

On behalf of the Ubuntu Release Team,

Adam Conrad
