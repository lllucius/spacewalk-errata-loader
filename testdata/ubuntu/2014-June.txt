linux vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

Software Description:
- linux: Linux kernel

Details:

Pinkie Pie discovered a flaw in the Linux kernel's futex subsystem. An
unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of
service (system crash) or gain administrative privileges. (CVE-2014-3153)

Dmitry Vyukov reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's handling of IPv6 UDP
Fragmentation Offload (UFO) processing. A remote attacker could leverage
this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2013-4387)

Hannes Frederic Sowa discovered a flaw in the Linux kernel's UDP
Fragmentation Offload (UFO). An unprivileged local user could exploit this
flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly gain
administrative privileges. (CVE-2013-4470)

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's IPC reference counting. An
unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of
service (OOM system crash). (CVE-2013-4483)

halfdog reported an error in the AMD K7 and K8 platform support in the
Linux kernel. An unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw on AMD
based systems to cause a denial of service (task kill) or possibly gain
privileges via a crafted application. (CVE-2014-1438)

Sasha Levin reported a bug in the Linux kernel's virtual memory management
subsystem. An unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw to cause a
denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2014-3122)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS:
  linux-image-2.6.32-61-386       2.6.32-61.124
  linux-image-2.6.32-61-generic   2.6.32-61.124

  linux-image-2.6.32-61-lpia      2.6.32-61.124
  linux-image-2.6.32-61-powerpc   2.6.32-61.124
  linux-image-2.6.32-61-powerpc-smp  2.6.32-61.124
  linux-image-2.6.32-61-powerpc64-smp  2.6.32-61.124
  linux-image-2.6.32-61-preempt   2.6.32-61.124
  linux-image-2.6.32-61-server    2.6.32-61.124
  linux-image-2.6.32-61-sparc64   2.6.32-61.124
  linux-image-2.6.32-61-sparc64-smp  2.6.32-61.124
  linux-image-2.6.32-61-versatile  2.6.32-61.124
  linux-image-2.6.32-61-virtual   2.6.32-61.124

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in OpenStack Nova.

Software Description:
- nova: OpenStack Compute cloud infrastructure

Details:

Darragh O'Reilly discovered that OpenStack Nova did not properly set up its
sudo configuration. If a different flaw was found in OpenStack Nova, this
vulnerability could be used to escalate privileges. This issue only
affected Ubuntu 13.10 and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. (CVE-2013-1068)

Bernhard M. Wiedemann and Pedraig Brady discovered that OpenStack Nova did
not properly verify the virtual size of a QCOW2 images. A remote
authenticated attacker could exploit this to create a denial of service via
disk consumption. This issue did not affect Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.
(CVE-2013-4463, CVE-2013-4469)

JuanFra Rodriguez Cardoso discovered that OpenStack Nova did not enforce
SSL connections when Nova was configured to use QPid and qpid_protocol is
set to 'ssl'. If a remote attacker were able to perform a man-in-the-middle
attack, this flaw could be exploited to view sensitive information. Ubuntu
does not use QPid with Nova by default. This issue did not affect Ubuntu
14.04 LTS. (CVE-2013-6491)

Loganathan Parthipan discovered that OpenStack Nova did not properly create
expected files during KVM live block migration. A remote authenticated
attacker could exploit this to obtain root disk snapshot contents via
ephemeral storage. This issue did not affect Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.
(CVE-2013-7130)

Stanislaw Pitucha discovered that OpenStack Nova did not enforce the image
format when rescuing an instance. A remote authenticated attacker could
exploit this to read host files. In the default installation, attackers
would be isolated by the libvirt guest AppArmor profile. This issue only
affected Ubuntu 13.10. (CVE-2014-0134)

Mark Heckmann discovered that OpenStack Nova did not enforce RBAC policy
when adding security group rules via the EC2 API. A remote authenticated
user could exploit this to gain unintended access to this API. This issue
only affected Ubuntu 13.10. (CVE-2014-0167)

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-2251-1
June 20, 2014

linux vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

Software Description:
- linux: Linux kernel

Details:

A bounds check error was discovered in the socket filter subsystem of the
Linux kernel. A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of
service (system crash) via crafted BPF instructions. (CVE-2014-3144)

A remainder calculation error was discovered in the socket filter subsystem
of the Linux kernel. A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial
of service (system crash) via crafted BPF instructions. (CVE-2014-3145)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS:
  linux-image-2.6.32-62-386       2.6.32-62.125
  linux-image-2.6.32-62-generic   2.6.32-62.125

  linux-image-2.6.32-62-lpia      2.6.32-62.125
  linux-image-2.6.32-62-powerpc   2.6.32-62.125
  linux-image-2.6.32-62-powerpc-smp  2.6.32-62.125
  linux-image-2.6.32-62-powerpc64-smp  2.6.32-62.125
  linux-image-2.6.32-62-preempt   2.6.32-62.125
  linux-image-2.6.32-62-server    2.6.32-62.125
  linux-image-2.6.32-62-sparc64   2.6.32-62.125
  linux-image-2.6.32-62-sparc64-smp  2.6.32-62.125
  linux-image-2.6.32-62-versatile  2.6.32-62.125
  linux-image-2.6.32-62-virtual   2.6.32-62.125

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

Message-ID: <20140620050013.GC28005@0c3.net>

Ubuntu announced its 13.10 (Saucy Salamander) release almost 9 months
ago, on October 17, 2013.  This was the second release with our new 9
month support cycle and, as such, the support period is now nearing
its end and Ubuntu 13.10 will reach end of life on Thursday, July
17th.  At that time, Ubuntu Security Notices will no longer include
information or updated packages for Ubuntu 13.10.

The supported upgrade path from Ubuntu 13.10 is via Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.
Instructions and caveats for the upgrade may be found at:

https://help.ubuntu.com/community/TrustyUpgrades

Ubuntu 14.04 LTS continues to be actively supported with security
updates and select high-impact bug fixes.  Announcements of security
updates for Ubuntu releases are sent to the ubuntu-security-announce
mailing list, information about which may be found at:

https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/ubuntu-security-announce

Since its launch in October 2004 Ubuntu has become one of the most
highly regarded Linux distributions with millions of users in homes,
schools, businesses and governments around the world. Ubuntu is Open
Source software, costs nothing to download, and users are free to
customise or alter their software in order to meet their needs.

On behalf of the Ubuntu Release Team,

Adam Conrad

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-2259-1
June 27, 2014

linux vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

Software Description:
- linux: Linux kernel

Details:

Salva Peir? discovered an information leak in the Linux kernel's media-
device driver. A local attacker could exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive
information from kernel memory. (CVE-2014-1739)

A bounds check error was discovered in the socket filter subsystem of the
Linux kernel. A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of
service (system crash) via crafted BPF instructions. (CVE-2014-3144)

A remainder calculation error was discovered in the socket filter subsystem
of the Linux kernel. A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial
of service (system crash) via crafted BPF instructions. (CVE-2014-3145)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:
  linux-image-3.2.0-65-generic    3.2.0-65.98
  linux-image-3.2.0-65-generic-pae  3.2.0-65.98
  linux-image-3.2.0-65-highbank   3.2.0-65.98
  linux-image-3.2.0-65-omap       3.2.0-65.98
  linux-image-3.2.0-65-powerpc-smp  3.2.0-65.98
  linux-image-3.2.0-65-powerpc64-smp  3.2.0-65.98
  linux-image-3.2.0-65-virtual    3.2.0-65.98

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

June 27, 2014

linux-lts-trusty vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

Software Description:
- linux-lts-trusty: Block storage devices (udeb)

Details:

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's pseudo tty (pty) device. An
unprivileged user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service
(system crash) or potentially gain administrator privileges.
(CVE-2014-0196)

Pinkie Pie discovered a flaw in the Linux kernel's futex subsystem. An
unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of
service (system crash) or gain administrative privileges. (CVE-2014-3153)

Matthew Daley reported an information leak in the floppy disk driver of the
Linux kernel. An unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw to obtain
potentially sensitive information from kernel memory. (CVE-2014-1738)

Matthew Daley reported a flaw in the handling of ioctl commands by the
floppy disk driver in the Linux kernel. An unprivileged local user could
exploit this flaw to gain administrative privileges if the floppy disk
module is loaded. (CVE-2014-1737)

A flaw was discovered in the handling of network packets when mergeable
buffers are disabled for virtual machines in the Linux kernel. Guest OS
users may exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (host OS crash) or
possibly gain privilege on the host OS. (CVE-2014-0077)

An information leak was discovered in the netfilter subsystem of the Linux
kernel. An attacker could exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive information
from kernel memory. (CVE-2014-2568)

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's ping sockets. An unprivileged
local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system
crash) or possibly gain privileges via a crafted application.
(CVE-2014-2851)

Sasha Levin reported a bug in the Linux kernel's virtual memory management
subsystem. An unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw to cause a
denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2014-3122)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:
  linux-image-3.13.0-30-generic   3.13.0-30.54~precise2
  linux-image-3.13.0-30-generic-lpae  3.13.0-30.54~precise2
