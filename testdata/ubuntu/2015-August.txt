==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-2713-1
August 18, 2015

linux vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

Software Description:
- linux: Linux kernel

Details:

Marcelo Ricardo Leitner discovered a race condition in the Linux kernel's
SCTP address configuration lists when using Address Configuration Change
(ASCONF) options on a socket. An unprivileged local user could exploit this
flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2015-3212)

A flaw was discovered in how the Linux kernel handles invalid UDP
checksums. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of
service using a flood of UDP packets with invalid checksums.
(CVE-2015-5364)

A flaw was discovered in how the Linux kernel handles invalid UDP
checksums. A remote attacker can cause a denial of service against
applications that use epoll by injecting a single packet with an invalid
checksum. (CVE-2015-5366)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:
  linux-image-3.2.0-89-generic    3.2.0-89.127
  linux-image-3.2.0-89-generic-pae  3.2.0-89.127
  linux-image-3.2.0-89-highbank   3.2.0-89.127
  linux-image-3.2.0-89-omap       3.2.0-89.127
  linux-image-3.2.0-89-powerpc-smp  3.2.0-89.127
  linux-image-3.2.0-89-powerpc64-smp  3.2.0-89.127
  linux-image-3.2.0-89-virtual    3.2.0-89.127

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

Subject: [USN-2722-1] GDK-PixBuf vulnerability
Message-ID: <55DDCFCB.1070706@canonical.com>

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-2722-1
August 26, 2015

gdk-pixbuf vulnerability
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 15.04
- Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

Summary:

GDK-PixBuf could be made to crash or run programs as your login if it
opened a specially crafted file.

Software Description:
- gdk-pixbuf: GDK Pixbuf library

Details:

Gustavo Grieco discovered that GDK-PixBuf incorrectly handled scaling
bitmap images. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a
BMP image file, a remote attacker could use this flaw to cause GDK-PixBuf
to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary
code.

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 15.04:
  libgdk-pixbuf2.0-0              2.31.3-1ubuntu0.1

Ubuntu 14.04 LTS:
  libgdk-pixbuf2.0-0              2.30.7-0ubuntu1.1

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:
  libgdk-pixbuf2.0-0              2.26.1-1ubuntu1.2

After a standard system update you need to restart your session to make
all the necessary changes.
