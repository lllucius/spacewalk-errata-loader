thunderbird vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 15.10
- Ubuntu 15.04
- Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in Thunderbird.

Software Description:
- thunderbird: Mozilla Open Source mail and newsgroup client

Details:

Christian Holler, David Major, Jesse Ruderman, Tyson Smith, Boris Zbarsky,
Randell Jesup, Olli Pettay, Karl Tomlinson, Jeff Walden, and Gary Kwong
discovered multiple memory safety issues in Thunderbird. If a user were
tricked in to opening a specially crafted message, an attacker could
potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via application
crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking
Thunderbird. (CVE-2015-4513)

Tyson Smith and David Keeler discovered a use-after-poison and buffer
overflow in NSS. An attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a
denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with
the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. (CVE-2015-7181,
CVE-2015-7182)

Ryan Sleevi discovered an integer overflow in NSPR. An attacker could
potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application
crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking
Thunderbird. (CVE-2015-7183)

Micha? Bentkowski discovered that adding white-space to hostnames that are
IP addresses can bypass same-origin protections. If a user were tricked in
to opening a specially crafted website in a browser-like context, an
attacker could potentially exploit this to conduct cross-site scripting
(XSS) attacks. (CVE-2015-7188)

Looben Yang discovered a buffer overflow during script interactions with
the canvas element in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to
opening a specially crafted website in a browser-like context, an attacker
could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via
application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the
user invoking Thunderbird. (CVE-2015-7189)

Shinto K Anto discovered that CORS preflight is bypassed when receiving
non-standard Content-Type headers in some circumstances. If a user were
tricked in to opening a specially crafted website in a browser-like
context, an attacker could potentially exploit this to bypass
same-origin restrictions. (CVE-2015-7193)

Gustavo Grieco discovered a buffer overflow in libjar in some
circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted
website in a browser-like context, an attacker could potentially exploit
this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute
arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird.
(CVE-2015-7194)

Ehsan Akhgari discovered a mechanism for a web worker to bypass secure
requirements for web sockets. If a user were tricked in to opening a
specially crafted website in a browser-like context, an attacker could
exploit this to bypass the mixed content web socket policy.
(CVE-2015-7197)

Ronald Crane discovered several vulnerabilities through code-inspection. If
a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website in a
browser-like context, an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause
a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with
the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. (CVE-2015-7198,
CVE-2015-7199, CVE-2015-7200)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 15.10:
  thunderbird                     1:38.4.0+build3-0ubuntu0.15.10.1

Ubuntu 15.04:
  thunderbird                     1:38.4.0+build3-0ubuntu0.15.04.1

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-2823-1
December 01, 2015

linux vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

Software Description:
- linux: Linux kernel

Details:

It was discovered that the SCTP protocol implementation in the Linux kernel
performed an incorrect sequence of protocol-initialization steps. A local
attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).
(CVE-2015-5283)

Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the Linux kernel's keyring handler attempted
to garbage collect incompletely instantiated keys. A local unprivileged
attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).
(CVE-2015-7872)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 14.04 LTS:
  linux-image-3.13.0-71-generic   3.13.0-71.114
  linux-image-3.13.0-71-generic-lpae  3.13.0-71.114
  linux-image-3.13.0-71-lowlatency  3.13.0-71.114
  linux-image-3.13.0-71-powerpc-e500  3.13.0-71.114
  linux-image-3.13.0-71-powerpc-e500mc  3.13.0-71.114
  linux-image-3.13.0-71-powerpc-smp  3.13.0-71.114
  linux-image-3.13.0-71-powerpc64-emb  3.13.0-71.114
  linux-image-3.13.0-71-powerpc64-smp  3.13.0-71.114

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

to garbage collect incompletely instantiated keys. A local unprivileged
attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).
(CVE-2015-7872)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 15.04:
  linux-image-3.19.0-39-generic   3.19.0-39.44
  linux-image-3.19.0-39-generic-lpae  3.19.0-39.44
  linux-image-3.19.0-39-lowlatency  3.19.0-39.44
  linux-image-3.19.0-39-powerpc-e500mc  3.19.0-39.44
  linux-image-3.19.0-39-powerpc-smp  3.19.0-39.44
  linux-image-3.19.0-39-powerpc64-emb  3.19.0-39.44
  linux-image-3.19.0-39-powerpc64-smp  3.19.0-39.44

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

Ubuntu Security Notice USN-2840-1
December 17, 2015

linux vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

Software Description:
- linux: Linux kernel

Details:

Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the Linux kernel's keyring handler attempted
to garbage collect incompletely instantiated keys. A local unprivileged
attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).
(CVE-2015-7872)

Jan Beulich discovered that the KVM svm hypervisor implementation in the
Linux kernel did not properly catch Debug exceptions on AMD processors. An
attacker in a guest virtual machine could use this to cause a denial of
service (system crash) in the host OS. (CVE-2015-8104)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:
  linux-image-3.2.0-96-generic    3.2.0-96.136
  linux-image-3.2.0-96-generic-pae  3.2.0-96.136
  linux-image-3.2.0-96-highbank   3.2.0-96.136
  linux-image-3.2.0-96-omap       3.2.0-96.136
  linux-image-3.2.0-96-powerpc-smp  3.2.0-96.136
  linux-image-3.2.0-96-powerpc64-smp  3.2.0-96.136
  linux-image-3.2.0-96-virtual    3.2.0-96.136

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

Jan Beulich discovered that the KVM svm hypervisor implementation in the
Linux kernel did not properly catch Debug exceptions on AMD processors. An
attacker in a guest virtual machine could use this to cause a denial of
service (system crash) in the host OS. (CVE-2015-8104)

??? discovered that the ppp implementation in the Linux kernel did
not ensure that certain slot numbers are valid. A local attacker with the
privilege to call ioctl() on /dev/ppp could cause a denial of service
(system crash). (CVE-2015-7799)

It was discovered that the driver for Digi Neo and ClassicBoard devices did
not properly initialize data structures. A local attacker could use this to
obtain sensitive information from the kernel. (CVE-2015-7885)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 14.04 LTS:
  linux-image-3.13.0-73-generic   3.13.0-73.116
  linux-image-3.13.0-73-generic-lpae  3.13.0-73.116
  linux-image-3.13.0-73-lowlatency  3.13.0-73.116
  linux-image-3.13.0-73-powerpc-e500  3.13.0-73.116
  linux-image-3.13.0-73-powerpc-e500mc  3.13.0-73.116
  linux-image-3.13.0-73-powerpc-smp  3.13.0-73.116
  linux-image-3.13.0-73-powerpc64-emb  3.13.0-73.116
  linux-image-3.13.0-73-powerpc64-smp  3.13.0-73.116

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

  linux-image-4.2.0-1016-raspi2   4.2.0-1016.23

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

Subject: [USN-2840-2] Linux kernel (OMAP4) vulnerability
Message-ID: <20151217195918.GN3023@nxnw.org>

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-2840-2
December 17, 2015

linux-ti-omap4 vulnerability
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

Summary:

The system could be made to crash under certain conditions.

Software Description:
- linux-ti-omap4: Linux kernel for OMAP4

Details:

Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the Linux kernel's keyring handler attempted
to garbage collect incompletely instantiated keys. A local unprivileged
attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:
  linux-image-3.2.0-1475-omap4    3.2.0-1475.97

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

sosreport vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 15.10
- Ubuntu 15.04
- Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

Summary:

sosreport could be made to expose sensitive information or overwrite files
as the administrator.

Software Description:
- sosreport: Set of tools to gather troubleshooting data from a system

Details:

Dolev Farhi discovered an information disclosure issue in SoS. If the
/etc/fstab file contained passwords, the passwords were included in the
SoS report. This issue only affected Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. (CVE-2014-3925)

Mateusz Guzik discovered that SoS incorrectly handled temporary files. A
local attacker could possibly use this issue to overwrite arbitrary files
or gain access to temporary file contents containing sensitive system
information. (CVE-2015-7529)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 15.10:
  sosreport                       3.2-2ubuntu1.1

Ubuntu 15.04:
  sosreport                       3.2-2ubuntu0.1

Ubuntu 14.04 LTS:
  sosreport                       3.1-1ubuntu2.2

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.

linux-lts-trusty vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

Software Description:
- linux-lts-trusty: Linux hardware enablement kernel from Trusty

Details:

Felix Wilhelm discovered a race condition in the Xen paravirtualized
drivers which can cause double fetch vulnerabilities. An attacker in the
paravirtualized guest could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service
(crash the host) or potentially execute arbitrary code on the host.
(CVE-2015-8550)

Konrad Rzeszutek Wilk discovered the Xen PCI backend driver does not
perform sanity checks on the device's state. An attacker could exploit this
flaw to cause a denial of service (NULL dereference) on the host.
(CVE-2015-8551)

Konrad Rzeszutek Wilk discovered the Xen PCI backend driver does not
perform sanity checks on the device's state. An attacker could exploit this
flaw to cause a denial of service by flooding the logging system with
WARN() messages causing the initial domain to exhaust disk space.
(CVE-2015-8552)

Jann Horn discovered a ptrace issue with user namespaces in the Linux
kernel. The namespace owner could potentially exploit this flaw by ptracing
a root owned process entering the user namespace to elevate its privileges
and potentially gain access outside of the namespace.
(http://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1527374)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:
  linux-image-3.13.0-74-generic   3.13.0-74.118~precise1
  linux-image-3.13.0-74-generic-lpae  3.13.0-74.118~precise1

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.
Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages
(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,
linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform
this as well.

Message-ID: <5675F9EC.2000207@canonical.com>

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-2852-1
December 19, 2015

linux-raspi2 vulnerability
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 15.10

Summary:

The system could be made to provide access outside of namespace sandbox.

Software Description:
- linux-raspi2: Linux kernel for Raspberry Pi 2

Details:

Jann Horn discovered a ptrace issue with user namespaces in the Linux
kernel. The namespace owner could potentially exploit this flaw by ptracing
a root owned process entering the user namespace to elevate its privileges
and potentially gain access outside of the namespace.
(http://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1527374)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 15.10:
  linux-image-4.2.0-1017-raspi2   4.2.0-1017.24

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.
Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages
(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,
linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform
this as well.

Ubuntu Security Notice USN-2853-1
December 20, 2015

linux-lts-wily vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

Software Description:
- linux-lts-wily: Linux hardware enablement kernel from Wily

Details:

Felix Wilhelm discovered a race condition in the Xen paravirtualized
drivers which can cause double fetch vulnerabilities. An attacker in the
paravirtualized guest could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service
(crash the host) or potentially execute arbitrary code on the host.
(CVE-2015-8550)

Konrad Rzeszutek Wilk discovered the Xen PCI backend driver does not
perform sanity checks on the device's state. An attacker could exploit this
flaw to cause a denial of service (NULL dereference) on the host.
(CVE-2015-8551)

Konrad Rzeszutek Wilk discovered the Xen PCI backend driver does not
perform sanity checks on the device's state. An attacker could exploit this
flaw to cause a denial of service by flooding the logging system with
WARN() messages causing the initial domain to exhaust disk space.
(CVE-2015-8552)

Jann Horn discovered a ptrace issue with user namespaces in the Linux
kernel. The namespace owner could potentially exploit this flaw by ptracing
a root owned process entering the user namespace to elevate its privileges
and potentially gain access outside of the namespace.
(http://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1527374)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 14.04 LTS:
  linux-image-4.2.0-22-generic    4.2.0-22.27~14.04.1
  linux-image-4.2.0-22-generic-lpae  4.2.0-22.27~14.04.1
  linux-image-4.2.0-22-lowlatency  4.2.0-22.27~14.04.1
  linux-image-4.2.0-22-powerpc-e500mc  4.2.0-22.27~14.04.1
