Subject: [USN-2183-2] dpkg vulnerability
Message-ID: <53625DF9.2060600@canonical.com>

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-2183-2
May 01, 2014

dpkg vulnerability
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 13.10
- Ubuntu 12.10
- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

Summary:

A malicious source package could write files outside the unpack directory.

Software Description:
- dpkg: Debian package management system

Details:

USN-2183-1 fixed a vulnerability in dpkg. Javier Serrano Polo discovered
that the fix introduced a vulnerability in releases with an older version
of the patch utility. This update fixes the problem.

Original advisory details:

 Jakub Wilk discovered that dpkg incorrectly certain paths and symlinks when
 unpacking source packages. If a user or an automated system were tricked
 into unpacking a specially crafted source package, a remote attacker could
 modify files outside the target unpack directory, leading to a denial of
 service or potentially gaining access to the system.

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 14.04 LTS:
  libdpkg-perl                    1.17.5ubuntu5.2

Ubuntu 13.10:
  libdpkg-perl                    1.16.12ubuntu1.2

Ubuntu 12.10:
  libdpkg-perl                    1.16.7ubuntu6.2

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:
  libdpkg-perl                    1.16.1.2ubuntu7.4

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS:
  dpkg-dev                        1.15.5.6ubuntu4.8

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.

Details:

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's pseudo tty (pty) device. An

  linux-image-3.2.0-61-virtual    3.2.0-61.93

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

python-django vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 13.10
- Ubuntu 12.10
- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

Summary:

Django applications could be made to expose sensitive information over
the network.

Software Description:
- python-django: High-level Python web development framework

Details:

Stephen Stewart, Michael Nelson, Natalia Bidart and James Westby
discovered that Django improperly removed Vary and Cache-Control headers
from HTTP responses when replying to a request from an Internet Explorer
or Chrome Frame client. An attacker may use this to retrieve private data
or poison caches. This update removes workarounds for bugs in Internet
Explorer 6 and 7. (CVE-2014-1418)

Peter Kuma and Gavin Wahl discovered that Django did not correctly
validate some malformed URLs, which are accepted by some browsers. An
attacker may use this to cause unexpected redirects. An update has been
provided for 12.04 LTS, 12.10, 13.10, and 14.04 LTS; this issue remains
unfixed for 10.04 LTS as no "is_safe_url()" functionality existed in
this version.

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 14.04 LTS:
  python-django                   1.6.1-2ubuntu0.3

Ubuntu 13.10:
  python-django                   1.5.4-1ubuntu1.3

Subject: Ubuntu 12.10 (Quantal Quetzal) End of Life reached on May 16 2014
Message-ID: <20140517013706.GY28005@0c3.net>

This is a follow-up to the End of Life warning sent last month to
confirm that as of today (May 16, 2014), Ubuntu 12.10 is no longer
supported.  No more package updates will be accepted to 12.10, and
it will be archived to old-releases.ubuntu.com in the coming weeks.

The original End of Life warning follows, with upgrade instructions:

Ubuntu announced its 12.10 (Quantal Quetzal) release more than 18 months
ago, on October 18, 2012.  Since changes to the Ubuntu support cycle
mean that Ubuntu 13.04 has reached end of life before Ubuntu 12.10, the
support cycle for Ubuntu 12.10 has been extended slightly to overlap
with the release of Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.  This will allow users to move
directly from Ubuntu 12.10 to Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (via Ubuntu 13.10).

This period of overlap is now coming to a close, and we will be retiring
Ubuntu 12.10 on Friday, May 16, 2014.  At that time, Ubuntu Security
Notices will no longer include information or updated packages for
Ubuntu 12.10.

The supported upgrade path from Ubuntu 12.10 is via Ubuntu 13.10, though
we highly recommend that once you've upgraded to 13.10, you continue to
upgrade through to 14.04, as 13.10's support will end in July.

Instructions and caveats for the upgrade may be found at:

https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SaucyUpgrades
https://help.ubuntu.com/community/TrustyUpgrades

Ubuntu 13.10 and 14.04 continue to be actively supported with security
updates and select high-impact bug fixes.  Announcements of security
updates for Ubuntu releases are sent to the ubuntu-security-announce
mailing list, information about which may be found at:

https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/ubuntu-security-announce

Since its launch in October 2004 Ubuntu has become one of the most
highly regarded Linux distributions with millions of users in homes,
schools, businesses and governments around the world. Ubuntu is Open
Source software, costs nothing to download, and users are free to
customize or alter their software in order to meet their needs.

On behalf of the Ubuntu Release Team,

Adam Conrad

Ubuntu Security Notice USN-2219-1
May 26, 2014

linux vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

Software Description:
- linux: Linux kernel

Details:

Matthew Daley reported an information leak in the floppy disk driver of the
Linux kernel. An unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw to obtain
potentially sensitive information from kernel memory. (CVE-2014-1738)

Matthew Daley reported a flaw in the handling of ioctl commands by the
floppy disk driver in the Linux kernel. An unprivileged local user could
exploit this flaw to gain administrative privileges if the floppy disk
module is loaded. (CVE-2014-1737)

A flaw was discovered in the Reliable Datagram Sockets (RDS) protocol
implementation in the Linux kernel for systems that lack RDS transports. An
unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of
service (system crash). (CVE-2013-7339)

An error was discovered in the Reliable Datagram Sockets (RDS) protocol
stack in the Linux kernel. A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a
denial of service (system crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact.
(CVE-2014-2678)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS:
  linux-image-2.6.32-60-386       2.6.32-60.122
  linux-image-2.6.32-60-generic   2.6.32-60.122

  linux-image-2.6.32-60-lpia      2.6.32-60.122
  linux-image-2.6.32-60-powerpc   2.6.32-60.122
  linux-image-2.6.32-60-powerpc-smp  2.6.32-60.122
  linux-image-2.6.32-60-powerpc64-smp  2.6.32-60.122

  linux-image-2.6.32-60-virtual   2.6.32-60.122

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

Ubuntu Security Notice USN-2224-1
May 27, 2014

linux-lts-raring vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

Software Description:
- linux-lts-raring: Linux hardware enablement kernel from Raring

Details:

Matthew Daley reported an information leak in the floppy disk driver of the
Linux kernel. An unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw to obtain
potentially sensitive information from kernel memory. (CVE-2014-1738)

Matthew Daley reported a flaw in the handling of ioctl commands by the
floppy disk driver in the Linux kernel. An unprivileged local user could
exploit this flaw to gain administrative privileges if the floppy disk
module is loaded. (CVE-2014-1737)

A flaw was discovered in the vhost-net subsystem of the Linux kernel. Guest
OS users could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (host OS
crash). (CVE-2014-0055)

A flaw was discovered in the handling of network packets when mergeable
buffers are disabled for virtual machines in the Linux kernel. Guest OS
users may exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (host OS crash) or
possibly gain privilege on the host OS. (CVE-2014-0077)

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's handling of the SCTP handshake.
A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service
(system crash). (CVE-2014-0101)

A flaw was discovered in the handling of routing information in Linux
kernel's IPv6 stack. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a
denial of service (memory consumption) via a flood of ICMPv6 router
advertisement packets. (CVE-2014-2309)

An error was discovered in the Linux kernel's DCCP protocol support. A
remote attacked could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service
(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2014-2523)

Max Sydorenko discovered a race condition in the Atheros 9k wireless driver
in the Linux kernel. This race could be exploited by remote attackers to
cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2014-2672)

An error was discovered in the Reliable Datagram Sockets (RDS) protocol
stack in the Linux kernel. A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a
denial of service (system crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact.
(CVE-2014-2678)

Yaara Rozenblum discovered a race condition in the Linux kernel's Generic
IEEE 802.11 Networking Stack (mac80211). Remote attackers could exploit
this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2014-2706)

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's ping sockets. An unprivileged
local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system
crash) or possibly gain privileges via a crafted application.
(CVE-2014-2851)

Sasha Levin reported a bug in the Linux kernel's virtual memory management
subsystem. An unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw to cause a
denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2014-3122)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:
  linux-image-3.8.0-41-generic    3.8.0-41.60~precise1

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.
