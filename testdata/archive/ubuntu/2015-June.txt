Message-ID: <5578B405.1090709@canonical.com>

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-2636-1
June 10, 2015

linux-lts-vivid vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

Software Description:
- linux-lts-vivid: Linux hardware enablement kernel from Vivid

Details:

Xiong Zhou discovered a bug in the way the EXT4 filesystem handles
fallocate zero range functionality when the page size is greater than the
block size. A local attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of
service (system crash). (CVE-2015-0275)

Wen Xu discovered a use-after-free flaw in the Linux kernel's ipv4 ping
support. A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service
(system crash) or gain administrative privileges on the system.
(CVE-2015-3636)

A memory corruption flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's scsi
subsystem. A local attacker could potentially exploit this flaw to cause a
denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2015-4036)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 14.04 LTS:
  linux-image-3.19.0-20-generic   3.19.0-20.20~14.04.1
  linux-image-3.19.0-20-generic-lpae  3.19.0-20.20~14.04.1
  linux-image-3.19.0-20-lowlatency  3.19.0-20.20~14.04.1
  linux-image-3.19.0-20-powerpc-e500mc  3.19.0-20.20~14.04.1
  linux-image-3.19.0-20-powerpc-smp  3.19.0-20.20~14.04.1
  linux-image-3.19.0-20-powerpc64-emb  3.19.0-20.20~14.04.1
  linux-image-3.19.0-20-powerpc64-smp  3.19.0-20.20~14.04.1

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

Ubuntu Security Notice USN-2631-1
June 10, 2015

linux vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

Software Description:
- linux: Linux kernel

Details:

Jan Beulich discovered the Xen virtual machine subsystem of the Linux
kernel did not properly restrict access to PCI command registers. A local
guest user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (host
crash). (CVE-2015-2150)

A privilege escalation was discovered in the fork syscall via the int80
entry on 64 bit kernels with 32 bit emulation support. An unprivileged
local attacker could exploit this flaw to increase their privileges on the
system. (CVE-2015-2830)

A memory corruption issue was discovered in AES decryption when using the
Intel AES-NI accelerated code path. A remote attacker could exploit this
flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) or potentially escalate
privileges on Intel base machines with AEC-GCM mode IPSec security
association. (CVE-2015-3331)

Wen Xu discovered a use-after-free flaw in the Linux kernel's ipv4 ping
support. A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service
(system crash) or gain administrative privileges on the system.
(CVE-2015-3636)

Carl H Lunde discovered missing sanity checks in the the Linux kernel's UDF
file system (CONFIG_UDF_FS). A local attack could exploit this flaw to cause
a denial of service (system crash) by using a corrupted filesystem image.
(CVE-2015-4167)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:
  linux-image-3.2.0-85-generic    3.2.0-85.122
  linux-image-3.2.0-85-generic-pae  3.2.0-85.122
  linux-image-3.2.0-85-highbank   3.2.0-85.122
  linux-image-3.2.0-85-omap       3.2.0-85.122
  linux-image-3.2.0-85-powerpc-smp  3.2.0-85.122
  linux-image-3.2.0-85-powerpc64-smp  3.2.0-85.122
  linux-image-3.2.0-85-virtual    3.2.0-85.122

Subject: [USN-2639-1] OpenSSL vulnerabilities
Message-ID: <5579CFF5.5010209@canonical.com>

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-2639-1
June 11, 2015

openssl vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 15.04
- Ubuntu 14.10
- Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in OpenSSL.

Software Description:
- openssl: Secure Socket Layer (SSL) cryptographic library and tools

Details:

Praveen Kariyanahalli, Ivan Fratric and Felix Groebert discovered that
OpenSSL incorrectly handled memory when buffering DTLS data. A remote
attacker could use this issue to cause OpenSSL to crash, resulting in a
denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2014-8176)

Joseph Barr-Pixton discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled malformed
ECParameters structures. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause
OpenSSL to hang, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2015-1788)

Robert Swiecki and Hanno B?ck discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled
certain ASN1_TIME strings. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause
OpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2015-1789)

Michal Zalewski discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled missing content
when parsing ASN.1-encoded PKCS#7 blobs. A remote attacker could use this
issue to cause OpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of service.
(CVE-2015-1790)

Emilia K?sper discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled NewSessionTicket
when being used by a multi-threaded client. A remote attacker could use
this issue to cause OpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of service.
(CVE-2015-1791)

Johannes Bauer discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled verifying
signedData messages using the CMS code. A remote attacker could use this
issue to cause OpenSSL to hang, resulting in a denial of service.
(CVE-2015-1792)

As a security improvement, this update also modifies OpenSSL behaviour to
reject DH key sizes below 768 bits, preventing a possible downgrade
attack.

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 15.04:
  libssl1.0.0                     1.0.1f-1ubuntu11.4

Ubuntu 14.10:
  libssl1.0.0                     1.0.1f-1ubuntu9.8

Ubuntu 14.04 LTS:
  libssl1.0.0                     1.0.1f-1ubuntu2.15

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:
  libssl1.0.0                     1.0.1-4ubuntu5.31

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

Message-ID: <557F4B7E.9090209@canonical.com>

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-2640-1
June 15, 2015

linux vulnerability
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

Summary:

The system could be made to run programs as an administrator.

Software Description:
- linux: Linux kernel

Details:

Philip Pettersson discovered a privilege escalation when using overlayfs
mounts inside of user namespaces. A local user could exploit this flaw to
gain administrative privileges on the system.

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:
  linux-image-3.2.0-86-generic    3.2.0-86.123
  linux-image-3.2.0-86-generic-pae  3.2.0-86.123
  linux-image-3.2.0-86-highbank   3.2.0-86.123
  linux-image-3.2.0-86-omap       3.2.0-86.123
  linux-image-3.2.0-86-powerpc-smp  3.2.0-86.123
  linux-image-3.2.0-86-powerpc64-smp  3.2.0-86.123
  linux-image-3.2.0-86-virtual    3.2.0-86.123

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

Subject: [USN-2655-1] Tomcat vulnerabilities
Message-ID: <558BF527.9000104@canonical.com>

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-2655-1
June 25, 2015

tomcat6 vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in Tomcat.

Software Description:
- tomcat6: Servlet and JSP engine

Details:

It was discovered that Tomcat incorrectly handled data with malformed
chunked transfer coding. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to
conduct HTTP request smuggling attacks, or cause Tomcat to consume
resources, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2014-0227)

It was discovered that Tomcat incorrectly handled HTTP responses occurring
before the entire request body was finished being read. A remote attacker
could possibly use this issue to cause memory consumption, resulting in a
denial of service. (CVE-2014-0230)

It was discovered that the Tomcat Expression Language (EL) implementation
incorrectly handled accessible interfaces implemented by inaccessible
classes. An attacker could possibly use this issue to bypass a
SecurityManager protection mechanism. (CVE-2014-7810)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:
  libtomcat6-java                 6.0.35-1ubuntu3.6

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.
