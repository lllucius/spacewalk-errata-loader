samba vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 15.10
- Ubuntu 15.04
- Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in Samba.

Software Description:
- samba: SMB/CIFS file, print, and login server for Unix

Details:

Thilo Uttendorfer discovered that the Samba LDAP server incorrectly handled
certain packets. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause the LDAP
server to stop responding, resulting in a denial of service. This issue
only affected Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, Ubuntu 15.04 and Ubuntu 15.10.
(CVE-2015-3223)

Jan Kasprzak discovered that Samba incorrectly handled certain symlinks. A
remote attacker could use this issue to access files outside the exported
share path. (CVE-2015-5252)

Stefan Metzmacher discovered that Samba did not enforce signing when
creating encrypted connections. If a remote attacker were able to perform a
man-in-the-middle attack, this flaw could be exploited to view sensitive
information. (CVE-2015-5296)

It was discovered that Samba incorrectly performed access control when
using the VFS shadow_copy2 module. A remote attacker could use this issue
to access snapshots, contrary to intended permissions. (CVE-2015-5299)

Douglas Bagnall discovered that Samba incorrectly handled certain string
lengths. A remote attacker could use this issue to possibly access
sensitive information. (CVE-2015-5330)

It was discovered that the Samba LDAP server incorrectly handled certain
packets. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause the LDAP server to
stop responding, resulting in a denial of service. This issue only affected
Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, Ubuntu 15.04 and Ubuntu 15.10. (CVE-2015-7540)

Andrew Bartlett discovered that Samba incorrectly checked administrative
privileges during creation of machine accounts. A remote attacker could
possibly use this issue to bypass intended access restrictions in certain
environments. This issue only affected Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, Ubuntu 15.04 and
Ubuntu 15.10. (CVE-2015-8467)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 15.10:
  samba                           2:4.1.17+dfsg-4ubuntu3.1

Ubuntu 15.04:
  samba                           2:4.1.13+dfsg-4ubuntu3.1

Ubuntu 14.04 LTS:
  samba                           2:4.1.6+dfsg-1ubuntu2.14.04.11

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:
  samba                           2:3.6.3-2ubuntu2.13

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.

ldb vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 15.10
- Ubuntu 15.04
- Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in ldb.

Software Description:
- ldb: LDAP-like embedded database

Details:

Thilo Uttendorfer discovered that the ldb incorrectly handled certain zero
values. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause applications using
ldb, such as Samba, to stop responding, resulting in a denial of service.
(CVE-2015-3223)

Douglas Bagnall discovered that ldb incorrectly handled certain string
lengths. A remote attacker could use this issue to possibly access
sensitive information from memory of applications using ldb, such as Samba.
(CVE-2015-5330)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 15.10:
  libldb1                         2:1.1.20-2ubuntu0.1

Ubuntu 15.04:
  libldb1                         1:1.1.18-1ubuntu0.1

Ubuntu 14.04 LTS:
  libldb1                         1:1.1.16-1ubuntu0.1

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:
  libldb1                         1:1.1.4-1ubuntu0.1

After a standard system update you need to restart applications using ldb,
such as Samba, to make all the necessary changes.

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-2857-1
January 05, 2016

linux vulnerability
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 15.04

Summary:

The system could be made to run programs as an administrator.

Software Description:
- linux: Linux kernel

Details:

Nathan Williams discovered that overlayfs in the Linux kernel incorrectly
handled setattr operations. A local unprivileged attacker could use this to
create files with administrative permission attributes and execute
arbitrary code with elevated privileges.

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 15.04:
  linux-image-3.19.0-43-generic   3.19.0-43.49
  linux-image-3.19.0-43-generic-lpae  3.19.0-43.49
  linux-image-3.19.0-43-lowlatency  3.19.0-43.49
  linux-image-3.19.0-43-powerpc-e500mc  3.19.0-43.49
  linux-image-3.19.0-43-powerpc-smp  3.19.0-43.49
  linux-image-3.19.0-43-powerpc64-emb  3.19.0-43.49
  linux-image-3.19.0-43-powerpc64-smp  3.19.0-43.49

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.
Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages
(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,
linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform
this as well.

Ubuntu Security Notice USN-2863-1
January 07, 2016

openssl vulnerability
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

Summary:

OpenSSL could be made to expose sensitive information over the network.

Software Description:
- openssl: Secure Socket Layer (SSL) cryptographic library and tools

Details:

Karthikeyan Bhargavan and Gaetan Leurent discovered that OpenSSL
incorrectly allowed MD5 to be used for TLS 1.2 connections. If a remote
attacker were able to perform a man-in-the-middle attack, this flaw could
be exploited to view sensitive information.

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:
  libssl1.0.0                     1.0.1-4ubuntu5.33

Ronald Crane dicovered an integer overflow when processing MP4 format
video in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a
specially crafted website in a browsing context, an attacker could
potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application
crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking
Thunderbird. (CVE-2015-7213)

Tsubasa Iinuma discovered a way to bypass same-origin restrictions using
data: and view-source: URLs. If a user were tricked in to opening a
specially crafted website in a browsing context, an attacker could
potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive information and read local
files. (CVE-2015-7214)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 15.10:
  thunderbird                     1:38.5.1+build2-0ubuntu0.15.10.1

Ubuntu 15.04:
  thunderbird                     1:38.5.1+build2-0ubuntu0.15.04.1

Ubuntu 14.04 LTS:
  thunderbird                     1:38.5.1+build2-0ubuntu0.14.04.1

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:
  thunderbird                     1:38.5.1+build2-0ubuntu0.12.04.1

After a standard system update you need to restart Thunderbird to make
all the necessary changes.

Subject: Ubuntu 15.04 (Vivid Vervet) reaches End of Life on February 4 2016
Message-ID: <20160114003714.GN1296@0c3.net>

Ubuntu announced its 15.04 (Vivid Vervet) release almost 9 months
ago, on April 23, 2015.  As a non-LTS release, 15.04 has a 9-month
month support cycle and, as such, the support period is now nearing
its end and Ubuntu 15.04 will reach end of life on Thursday, February
4th.  At that time, Ubuntu Security Notices will no longer include
information or updated packages for Ubuntu 15.04.

The supported upgrade path from Ubuntu 15.04 is via Ubuntu 15.10.
Instructions and caveats for the upgrade may be found at:

https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WilyUpgrades

Ubuntu 15.10 continues to be actively supported with security updates
and select high-impact bug fixes.  Announcements of security updates
for Ubuntu releases are sent to the ubuntu-security-announce mailing
list, information about which may be found at:

https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/ubuntu-security-announce

Since its launch in October 2004 Ubuntu has become one of the most
highly regarded Linux distributions with millions of users in homes,
schools, businesses and governments around the world. Ubuntu is Open
Source software, costs nothing to download, and users are free to
customise or alter their software in order to meet their needs.

On behalf of the Ubuntu Release Team,

Adam Conrad

openssh vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 15.10
- Ubuntu 15.04
- Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

Summary:

OpenSSH could be made to expose sensitive information over the network.

Software Description:
- openssh: secure shell (SSH) for secure access to remote machines

Details:

It was discovered that the OpenSSH client experimental support for resuming
connections contained multiple security issues. A malicious server could
use this issue to leak client memory to the server, including private
client user keys.

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 15.10:
  openssh-client                  1:6.9p1-2ubuntu0.1

Ubuntu 15.04:
  openssh-client                  1:6.7p1-5ubuntu1.4

Ubuntu 14.04 LTS:
  openssh-client                  1:6.6p1-2ubuntu2.4

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:
  openssh-client                  1:5.9p1-5ubuntu1.8

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-2870-1
January 19, 2016

linux vulnerability
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

Summary:

The system could be made to crash or run programs as an administrator.

Software Description:
- linux: Linux kernel

Details:

Yevgeny Pats discovered that the session keyring implementation in the
Linux kernel did not properly reference count when joining an existing
session keyring. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of
service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code with
administrative privileges.

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 14.04 LTS:
  linux-image-3.13.0-76-generic   3.13.0-76.120
  linux-image-3.13.0-76-generic-lpae  3.13.0-76.120
  linux-image-3.13.0-76-lowlatency  3.13.0-76.120
  linux-image-3.13.0-76-powerpc-e500  3.13.0-76.120
  linux-image-3.13.0-76-powerpc-e500mc  3.13.0-76.120
  linux-image-3.13.0-76-powerpc-smp  3.13.0-76.120
  linux-image-3.13.0-76-powerpc64-emb  3.13.0-76.120
  linux-image-3.13.0-76-powerpc64-smp  3.13.0-76.120

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.
Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages
(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,
linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform
this as well.

Subject: [USN-2870-2] Linux kernel (Trusty HWE) vulnerability
Message-ID: <20160119201539.GI8804@nxnw.org>

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-2870-2
January 19, 2016

linux-lts-trusty vulnerability
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

Summary:

The system could be made to crash or run programs as an administrator.

Software Description:
- linux-lts-trusty: Linux hardware enablement kernel from Trusty

Details:

Yevgeny Pats discovered that the session keyring implementation in the
Linux kernel did not properly reference count when joining an existing
session keyring. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of
service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code with
administrative privileges.

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:
  linux-image-3.13.0-76-generic   3.13.0-76.120~precise1
  linux-image-3.13.0-76-generic-lpae  3.13.0-76.120~precise1

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.
Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages
(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,
linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform
this as well.

==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 15.10
- Ubuntu 15.04
- Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

Summary:

Firefox could be made to crash or run programs as your login if it
opened a malicious website.

Software Description:
- firefox: Mozilla Open Source web browser

Details:

Bob Clary, Christian Holler, Nils Ohlmeier, Gary Kwong, Jesse Ruderman,
Carsten Book, Randell Jesup, Nicolas Pierron, Eric Rescorla, Tyson Smith,
and Gabor Krizsanits discovered multiple memory safety issues in Firefox.
If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an
attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via
application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the
user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2016-1930, CVE-2016-1931)

Gustavo Grieco discovered an out-of-memory crash when loading GIF images
in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially
crafted website, an attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of
service. (CVE-2016-1933)

Aki Helin discovered a buffer overflow when rendering WebGL content in
some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially
crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a
denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with
the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2016-1935)

It was discovered that a delay was missing when focusing the protocol
handler dialog. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted
website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to conduct
clickjacking attacks. (CVE-2016-1937)

Hanno B?ck discovered that calculations with mp_div and mp_exptmod in NSS
produce incorrect results in some circumstances, resulting in
cryptographic weaknesses. (CVE-2016-1938)

Nicholas Hurley discovered that Firefox allows for control characters to
be set in cookie names. An attacker could potentially exploit this to
conduct cookie injection attacks on some web servers. (CVE-2016-1939)

It was discovered that when certain invalid URLs are pasted in to the
addressbar, the addressbar contents may be manipulated to show the
location of arbitrary websites. An attacker could potentially exploit this
to conduct URL spoofing attacks. (CVE-2016-1942)

Ronald Crane discovered three vulnerabilities through code inspection. If
a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker
could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via
application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the
user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2016-1944, CVE-2016-1945, CVE-2016-1946)

Fran?ois Marier discovered that Application Reputation lookups didn't
work correctly, disabling warnings for potentially malicious downloads. An
attacker could potentially exploit this by tricking a user in to
downloading a malicious file. Other parts of the Safe Browsing feature
were unaffected by this. (CVE-2016-1947)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 15.10:
  firefox                         44.0+build3-0ubuntu0.15.10.1

Ubuntu 15.04:
  firefox                         44.0+build3-0ubuntu0.15.04.1

Ubuntu 14.04 LTS:
  firefox                         44.0+build3-0ubuntu0.14.04.1

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:
  firefox                         44.0+build3-0ubuntu0.12.04.1

After a standard system update you need to restart Firefox to make
all the necessary changes.

Subject: [USN-2883-1] OpenSSL vulnerability
Message-ID: <56AA38E3.7070505@canonical.com>

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-2883-1
January 28, 2016

openssl vulnerability
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 15.10

Summary:

OpenSSL could be made to expose sensitive information over the network.

Software Description:
- openssl: Secure Socket Layer (SSL) cryptographic library and tools

Details:

Antonio Sanso discovered that OpenSSL reused the same private DH exponent
for the life of a server process when configured with a X9.42 style
parameter file. This could allow a remote attacker to possibly discover the
server's private DH exponent when being used with non-safe primes.

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 15.10:
  libssl1.0.0                     1.0.2d-0ubuntu1.3

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.
