==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-2792-1
November 05, 2015

linux vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

Software Description:
- linux: Linux kernel

Details:

Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly initialize
IPC object state in certain situations. A local attacker could use this to
escalate their privileges, expose confidential information, or cause a
denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2015-7613)

It was discovered that the Linux kernel did not check if a new IPv6 MTU set
by a user space application was valid. A remote attacker could forge a
route advertisement with an invalid MTU that a user space daemon like
NetworkManager would honor and apply to the kernel, causing a denial of
service. (CVE-2015-0272)

It was discovered that in certain situations, a directory could be renamed
outside of a bind mounted location. An attacker could use this to escape
bind mount containment and gain access to sensitive information.
(CVE-2015-2925)

Moein Ghasemzadeh discovered that the USB WhiteHEAT serial driver contained
hardcoded attributes about the USB devices. An attacker could construct a
fake WhiteHEAT USB device that, when inserted, causes a denial of service
(system crash). (CVE-2015-5257)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:
  linux-image-3.2.0-93-generic    3.2.0-93.133
  linux-image-3.2.0-93-generic-pae  3.2.0-93.133
  linux-image-3.2.0-93-highbank   3.2.0-93.133
  linux-image-3.2.0-93-omap       3.2.0-93.133
  linux-image-3.2.0-93-powerpc-smp  3.2.0-93.133
  linux-image-3.2.0-93-powerpc64-smp  3.2.0-93.133
  linux-image-3.2.0-93-virtual    3.2.0-93.133

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-2796-1
November 05, 2015

linux-ti-omap4 vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

Software Description:
- linux-ti-omap4: Linux kernel for OMAP4

Details:

Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly initialize
IPC object state in certain situations. A local attacker could use this to
escalate their privileges, expose confidential information, or cause a
denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2015-7613)

It was discovered that the Linux kernel did not check if a new IPv6 MTU set
by a user space application was valid. A remote attacker could forge a
route advertisement with an invalid MTU that a user space daemon like
NetworkManager would honor and apply to the kernel, causing a denial of
service. (CVE-2015-0272)

It was discovered that in certain situations, a directory could be renamed
outside of a bind mounted location. An attacker could use this to escape
bind mount containment and gain access to sensitive information.
(CVE-2015-2925)

Moein Ghasemzadeh discovered that the USB WhiteHEAT serial driver contained
hardcoded attributes about the USB devices. An attacker could construct a
fake WhiteHEAT USB device that, when inserted, causes a denial of service
(system crash). (CVE-2015-5257)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:
  linux-image-3.2.0-1473-omap4    3.2.0-1473.95

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

 protected archives. If a user or automated system were tricked into
 processing a specially crafted zip archive, an attacker could possibly
 execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2015-7696)
  Gustavo Grieco discovered that unzip incorrectly handled certain malformed
 archives. If a user or automated system were tricked into processing a
 specially crafted zip archive, an attacker could possibly cause unzip to
 hang, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2015-7697)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 15.10:
  unzip                           6.0-17ubuntu1.2

Message-ID: <20151110031129.GD3486@nxnw.org>

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-2803-1
November 10, 2015

linux vulnerability
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 15.10

Summary:

The system could be made to crash under certain conditions.

Software Description:
- linux: Linux kernel

Details:

Ben Serebrin discovered that the KVM hypervisor implementation in the Linux
kernel did not properly catch Alignment Check exceptions. An attacker in a
guest virtual machine could use this to cause a denial of service (system
crash) in the host OS.

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 15.10:
  linux-image-4.2.0-18-generic    4.2.0-18.22
  linux-image-4.2.0-18-generic-lpae  4.2.0-18.22
  linux-image-4.2.0-18-lowlatency  4.2.0-18.22
  linux-image-4.2.0-18-powerpc-e500mc  4.2.0-18.22
  linux-image-4.2.0-18-powerpc-smp  4.2.0-18.22
  linux-image-4.2.0-18-powerpc64-emb  4.2.0-18.22
  linux-image-4.2.0-18-powerpc64-smp  4.2.0-18.22

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.
