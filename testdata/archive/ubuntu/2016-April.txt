Subject: [USN-2945-1] XChat-GNOME vulnerability
Message-ID: <5702BA41.3070403@canonical.com>

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-2945-1
April 04, 2016

xchat-gnome vulnerability
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 15.10
- Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

Summary:

XChat-GNOME could be made to expose sensitive information over the network.

Software Description:
- xchat-gnome: simple and featureful IRC client for GNOME

Details:

It was discovered that XChat-GNOME incorrectly verified the hostname in an
SSL certificate. An attacker could trick XChat-GNOME into trusting a rogue
server's certificate, which was signed by a trusted certificate authority,
to perform a man-in-the-middle attack.

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 15.10:
  xchat-gnome                     1:0.30.0~git20141005.816798-0ubuntu6.2

Ubuntu 14.04 LTS:
  xchat-gnome
1:0.30.0~git20131003.d20b8d+really20110821-0.2ubuntu12.2

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:
  xchat-gnome                     1:0.30.0~git20110821.e2a400-0.2ubuntu4.3

After a standard system update you need to restart XChat-GNOME to make
all the necessary changes.

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-2944-1
April 04, 2016

libav vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

Summary:

Libav could be made to crash or run programs as your login if it opened a
specially crafted file.

Software Description:
- libav: Multimedia player, server, encoder and transcoder

Details:

It was discovered that Libav incorrectly handled certain malformed media
files. If a user were tricked into opening a crafted media file, an
attacker could cause a denial of service via application crash, or possibly
execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the
program.

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:
  libavcodec53                    4:0.8.17-0ubuntu0.12.04.2
  libavformat53                   4:0.8.17-0ubuntu0.12.04.2

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.

Ubuntu Security Notice USN-2946-1
April 06, 2016

linux vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

Software Description:
- linux: Linux kernel

Details:

Venkatesh Pottem discovered a use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux
kernel's CXGB3 driver. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of
service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2015-8812)

Xiaofei Rex Guo discovered a timing side channel vulnerability in the Linux
Extended Verification Module (EVM). An attacker could use this to affect
system integrity. (CVE-2016-2085)

David Herrmann discovered that the Linux kernel incorrectly accounted file
descriptors to the original opener for in-flight file descriptors sent over
a unix domain socket. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of
service (resource exhaustion). (CVE-2016-2550)

It was discovered that the Linux kernel did not enforce limits on the
amount of data allocated to buffer pipes. A local attacker could use this
to cause a denial of service (resource exhaustion). (CVE-2016-2847)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 14.04 LTS:
  linux-image-3.13.0-85-generic   3.13.0-85.129
  linux-image-3.13.0-85-generic-lpae  3.13.0-85.129
  linux-image-3.13.0-85-lowlatency  3.13.0-85.129
  linux-image-3.13.0-85-powerpc-e500  3.13.0-85.129
  linux-image-3.13.0-85-powerpc-e500mc  3.13.0-85.129
  linux-image-3.13.0-85-powerpc-smp  3.13.0-85.129
  linux-image-3.13.0-85-powerpc64-emb  3.13.0-85.129
  linux-image-3.13.0-85-powerpc64-smp  3.13.0-85.129

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.
Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages
(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,
linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform
this as well.

Subject: [USN-2949-1] Linux kernel (Vivid HWE) vulnerabilities
Message-ID: <20160406080054.GG19944@nxnw.org>

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-2949-1
April 06, 2016

linux-lts-vivid vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

Software Description:
- linux-lts-vivid: Linux hardware enablement kernel from Vivid for Trusty

Details:

Venkatesh Pottem discovered a use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux
kernel's CXGB3 driver. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of
service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2015-8812)

Xiaofei Rex Guo discovered a timing side channel vulnerability in the Linux
Extended Verification Module (EVM). An attacker could use this to affect
system integrity. (CVE-2016-2085)

David Herrmann discovered that the Linux kernel incorrectly accounted file
descriptors to the original opener for in-flight file descriptors sent over
a unix domain socket. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of
service (resource exhaustion). (CVE-2016-2550)

It was discovered that the Linux kernel did not enforce limits on the
amount of data allocated to buffer pipes. A local attacker could use this
to cause a denial of service (resource exhaustion). (CVE-2016-2847)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 14.04 LTS:
  linux-image-3.19.0-58-generic   3.19.0-58.64~14.04.1

fix in the radeon driver introduced a regression that could cause a
system crash. This update fixes the problem.

We apologize for the inconvenience.

Original advisory details:

 Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the USB driver for Clie devices in the

 did not properly sanity check the interfaces and endpoints reported by the
 device. An attacker with physical access could cause a denial of service
 (system crash). (CVE-2015-7833)
 
 Venkatesh Pottem discovered a use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux
 kernel's CXGB3 driver. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of
 service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2015-8812)
