Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in Thunderbird.

Software Description:
- thunderbird: Mozilla Open Source mail and newsgroup client

Details:

Armin Razmdjou discovered that contents of locally readable files could
be made available via manipulation of form autocomplete in some
circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted
message with scripting enabled, an attacker could potentially exploit this
to obtain sensitive information. (CVE-2015-0822)

Abhishek Arya discovered an out-of-bounds read and write when rendering
SVG content in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening
a specially crafted message with scripting enabled, an attacker could
potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive information. (CVE-2015-0827)

Paul Bandha discovered a use-after-free in IndexedDB. If a user were
tricked in to opening a specially crafted message with scripting enabled,
an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service
via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of
the user invoking Thunderbird. (CVE-2015-0831)

Carsten Book, Christoph Diehl, Gary Kwong, Jan de Mooij, Liz Henry, Byron
Campen, Tom Schuster, and Ryan VanderMeulen discovered multiple memory
safety issues in Thunderbird. If a user were tricked in to opening a
specially crafted message with scripting enabled, an attacker could
potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via application
crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking
Thunderbird. (CVE-2015-0836)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 14.10:
  thunderbird                     1:31.5.0+build1-0ubuntu0.14.10.1

Ubuntu 14.04 LTS:
  thunderbird                     1:31.5.0+build1-0ubuntu0.14.04.1

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:
  thunderbird                     1:31.5.0+build1-0ubuntu0.12.04.1

Subject: [USN-2515-2] Linux kernel (Trusty HWE) vulnerabilities regression
Message-ID: <54F6C47E.8060903@canonical.com>

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-2515-2
March 04, 2015

linux-lts-trusty vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

Summary:

USN-2515-1 introduced a regression in the Linux kernel.

Software Description:
- linux-lts-trusty: Linux hardware enablement kernel from Trusty

Details:

USN-2515-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel. There was an unrelated
regression in the use of the virtual counter (CNTVCT) on arm64 architectures.
This update fixes the problem.

We apologize for the inconvenience.

Original advisory details:

A flaw was discovered in the Kernel Virtual Machine's (KVM) emulation of
the SYSTENTER instruction when the guest OS does not initialize the
SYSENTER MSRs. A guest OS user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of
service of the guest OS (crash) or potentially gain privileges on the guest
OS. (CVE-2015-0239)

Andy Lutomirski discovered an information leak in the Linux kernel's Thread
Local Storage (TLS) implementation allowing users to bypass the espfix to
obtain information that could be used to bypass the Address Space Layout
Randomization (ASLR) protection mechanism. A local user could exploit this
flaw to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory.
(CVE-2014-8133)

A restriction bypass was discovered in iptables when conntrack rules are
specified and the conntrack protocol handler module is not loaded into the
Linux kernel. This flaw can cause the firewall rules on the system to be
bypassed when conntrack rules are used. (CVE-2014-8160)

A flaw was discovered with file renaming in the linux kernel. A local user
could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (deadlock and system
hang). (CVE-2014-8559)

A flaw was discovered in how supplemental group memberships are handled in
certain namespace scenarios. A local user could exploit this flaw to bypass
file permission restrictions. (CVE-2014-8989)

A flaw was discovered in how Thread Local Storage (TLS) is handled by the
task switching function in the Linux kernel for x86_64 based machines. A
local user could exploit this flaw to bypass the Address Space Layout
Radomization (ASLR) protection mechanism. (CVE-2014-9419)

Prasad J Pandit reported a flaw in the rock_continue function of the Linux
kernel's ISO 9660 CDROM file system. A local user could exploit this flaw
to cause a denial of service (system crash or hang). (CVE-2014-9420)

A flaw was discovered in the fragment handling of the B.A.T.M.A.N. Advanced
Meshing Protocol in the Linux kernel. A remote attacker could exploit this
flaw to cause a denial of service (mesh-node system crash) via fragmented
packets. (CVE-2014-9428)

A race condition was discovered in the Linux kernel's key ring. A local
user could cause a denial of service (memory corruption or panic) or
possibly have unspecified impact via the keyctl commands. (CVE-2014-9529)

A memory leak was discovered in the ISO 9660 CDROM file system when parsing
rock ridge ER records. A local user could exploit this flaw to obtain
sensitive information from kernel memory via a crafted iso9660 image.
(CVE-2014-9584)

A flaw was discovered in the Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) of
the Virtual Dynamically linked Shared Objects (vDSO) location. This flaw
makes it easier for a local user to bypass the ASLR protection mechanism.
(CVE-2014-9585)

Dmitry Chernenkov discovered a buffer overflow in eCryptfs' encrypted file
name decoding. A local unprivileged user could exploit this flaw to cause a
denial of service (system crash) or potentially gain administrative
privileges. (CVE-2014-9683)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:
  linux-image-3.13.0-46-generic   3.13.0-46.77~precise1
  linux-image-3.13.0-46-generic-lpae  3.13.0-46.77~precise1

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

Subject: Ubuntu 10.04 (Lucid Lynx) reaches End of Life on April 30 2015
Message-ID: <20150318124208.GY28005@0c3.net>

Ubuntu announced its 10.04 (Lucid Lynx) release almost 5 years ago,
on April 29, 2010.  As with the earlier LTS releases, Ubuntu committed
to ongoing security and critical fixes for a period of 5 years. The
support period is now nearing its end and Ubuntu 10.04 will reach end
of life on Thursday, April 30th.  At that time, Ubuntu Security Notices
will no longer include information or updated packages for Ubuntu 10.04.

The supported upgrade path from Ubuntu 10.04 is via Ubuntu 12.04.
Users are encouraged to evaluate and upgrade to our latest 14.04 LTS
release via 12.04.  Instructions and caveats for the upgrades may be
found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/PreciseUpgrades and
https://help.ubuntu.com/community/TrustyUpgrades.  Ubuntu 12.04 and
14.04 continue to be actively supported with security updates and
select high-impact bug fixes. All announcements of official security
updates for Ubuntu releases are sent to the ubuntu-security-announce
mailing list, information about which may be found at
https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/ubuntu-security-announce.

Since its launch in October 2004 Ubuntu has become one of the most
highly regarded Linux distributions with millions of users in homes,
schools, businesses and governments around the world. Ubuntu is Open
Source software, costs nothing to download, and users are free to
customise or alter their software in order to meet their needs.

On behalf of the Ubuntu Release Team,

Adam Conrad

Ubuntu Security Notice USN-2541-1
March 24, 2015

linux vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

Software Description:
- linux: Linux kernel

Details:

The Linux kernel's splice system call did not correctly validate its
parameters. A local, unprivileged user could exploit this flaw to cause a
denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2014-7822)

A flaw was discovered in how Thread Local Storage (TLS) is handled by the
task switching function in the Linux kernel for x86_64 based machines. A
local user could exploit this flaw to bypass the Address Space Layout
Radomization (ASLR) protection mechanism. (CVE-2014-9419)

Dmitry Chernenkov discovered a buffer overflow in eCryptfs' encrypted file
name decoding. A local unprivileged user could exploit this flaw to cause a
denial of service (system crash) or potentially gain administrative
privileges. (CVE-2014-9683)

Sun Baoliang discovered a use after free flaw in the Linux kernel's SCTP
(Stream Control Transmission Protocol) subsystem during INIT collisions. A
remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service
(system crash) or potentially escalate their privileges on the system.
(CVE-2015-1421)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:
  linux-image-3.2.0-79-generic    3.2.0-79.115
  linux-image-3.2.0-79-generic-pae  3.2.0-79.115
  linux-image-3.2.0-79-highbank   3.2.0-79.115
  linux-image-3.2.0-79-omap       3.2.0-79.115
  linux-image-3.2.0-79-powerpc-smp  3.2.0-79.115
  linux-image-3.2.0-79-powerpc64-smp  3.2.0-79.115
  linux-image-3.2.0-79-virtual    3.2.0-79.115

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

linux-lts-utopic vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

Software Description:
- linux-lts-utopic: Linux hardware enablement kernel from Utopic

Details:

A flaw was discovered in the automatic loading of modules in the crypto
subsystem of the Linux kernel. A local user could exploit this flaw to load
installed kernel modules, increasing the attack surface and potentially
using this to gain administrative privileges. (CVE-2013-7421)

A flaw was discovered in the crypto subsystem when screening module names
for automatic module loading if the name contained a valid crypto module
name, eg. vfat(aes). A local user could exploit this flaw to load installed
kernel modules, increasing the attack surface and potentially using this to
gain administrative privileges. (CVE-2014-9644)

Sun Baoliang discovered a use after free flaw in the Linux kernel's SCTP
(Stream Control Transmission Protocol) subsystem during INIT collisions. A
remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service
(system crash) or potentially escalate their privileges on the system.
(CVE-2015-1421)

Marcelo Leitner discovered a flaw in the Linux kernel's routing of packets
to too many different dsts/too fast. A remote attacker can exploit this
flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2015-1465)
