==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-2554-1
April 01, 2015

gnupg, gnupg2 vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 14.10
- Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in GnuPG.

Software Description:
- gnupg: GNU privacy guard - a free PGP replacement
- gnupg2: GNU privacy guard - a free PGP replacement

Details:

Daniel Genkin, Lev Pachmanov, Itamar Pipman, and Eran Tromer discovered
that GnuPG was susceptible to an attack via physical side channels. A local
attacker could use this attack to possibly recover private keys.
(CVE-2014-3591)

Daniel Genkin, Adi Shamir, and Eran Tromer discovered that GnuPG was
susceptible to an attack via physical side channels. A local attacker could
use this attack to possibly recover private keys. (CVE-2015-0837)

Hanno B?ck discovered that GnuPG incorrectly handled certain malformed
keyrings. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a
malformed keyring, a remote attacker could use this issue to cause GnuPG to
crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary
code. (CVE-2015-1606, CVE-2015-1607)

In addition, this update improves GnuPG security by validating that the
keys returned by keyservers match those requested.

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 14.10:
  gnupg                           1.4.16-1.2ubuntu1.2

retained access to privileged internal methods if navigated to
unprivileged content. An attacker could potentially exploit this in
combination with another flaw, in order to execute arbitrary script in a
privileged context. (CVE-2015-0802)

Several type confusion issues were discovered in Firefox. If a user were
tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could
potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via application
crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking
Firefox. (CVE-2015-0803, CVE-2015-0804)

Ubuntu Security Notice USN-2560-1
April 08, 2015

linux vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

Software Description:
- linux: Linux kernel

Details:

An integer overflow was discovered in the stack randomization feature of
the Linux kernel on 64 bit platforms. A local attacker could exploit this
flaw to bypass the Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) mitigation
mechanism. (CVE-2015-1593)

An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel's handling of
userspace configuration of the link layer control (LLC). A local user could
exploit this flaw to read data from other sysctl settings. (CVE-2015-2041)

An information leak was discovered in how the Linux kernel handles setting
the Reliable Datagram Sockets (RDS) settings. A local user could exploit
this flaw to read data from other sysctl settings. (CVE-2015-2042)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:
  linux-image-3.2.0-80-generic    3.2.0-80.116
  linux-image-3.2.0-80-generic-pae  3.2.0-80.116
  linux-image-3.2.0-80-highbank   3.2.0-80.116
  linux-image-3.2.0-80-omap       3.2.0-80.116
  linux-image-3.2.0-80-powerpc-smp  3.2.0-80.116
  linux-image-3.2.0-80-powerpc64-smp  3.2.0-80.116
  linux-image-3.2.0-80-virtual    3.2.0-80.116

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 14.10
- Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

Summary:

dpkg could be tricked into bypassing source package signature checks.

Software Description:
- dpkg: Debian package management system

Details:

Jann Horn discovered that dpkg incorrectly validated signatures when
extracting local source packages. If a user or an automated system were
tricked into unpacking a specially crafted source package, a remote
attacker could bypass signature verification checks.

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 14.10:
  libdpkg-perl                    1.17.13ubuntu1.1

Ubuntu 14.04 LTS:
  libdpkg-perl                    1.17.5ubuntu5.4

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:
  libdpkg-perl                    1.16.1.2ubuntu7.6

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS:
  dpkg-dev                        1.15.5.6ubuntu4.10

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.

Ubuntu Security Notice USN-2579-1
April 27, 2015

autofs vulnerability
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 14.10

Summary:

autofs could be made to run programs as an administrator if program maps
were configured.

Software Description:

names, or revert to the previous names by using a new configuration option
called FORCE_STANDARD_PROGRAM_MAP_ENV.

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 14.10:
  autofs                          5.0.8-1ubuntu1.1

network-manager vulnerability
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 15.04
- Ubuntu 14.10
- Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

Summary:

NetworkManager would allow unintended access to files and modem device
configuration.

Software Description:
- network-manager: Network connection manager

Details:

Tavis Ormandy discovered that NetworkManager incorrectly filtered paths
when requested to read modem device contexts. A local attacker could
possibly use this issue to bypass privileges and manipulate modem device
configuration or read arbitrary files.

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 15.04:
  network-manager                 0.9.10.0-4ubuntu15.1

Ubuntu 14.10:
  network-manager                 0.9.8.8-0ubuntu28.1

Ubuntu 14.04 LTS:
  network-manager                 0.9.8.8-0ubuntu7.1

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

Ubuntu Security Notice USN-2583-1
April 30, 2015

linux vulnerability
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

Summary:

The system could be made to run programs as an administrator.

Software Description:
- linux: Linux kernel

Details:

A race condition between chown() and execve() was discovered in the Linux
kernel. A local attacker could exploit this race by using chown on a
setuid-user-binary to gain administrative privileges.

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS:
  linux-image-2.6.32-74-386       2.6.32-74.142
  linux-image-2.6.32-74-generic   2.6.32-74.142
  linux-image-2.6.32-74-generic-pae  2.6.32-74.142
  linux-image-2.6.32-74-ia64      2.6.32-74.142
  linux-image-2.6.32-74-lpia      2.6.32-74.142
  linux-image-2.6.32-74-powerpc   2.6.32-74.142
  linux-image-2.6.32-74-powerpc-smp  2.6.32-74.142
  linux-image-2.6.32-74-powerpc64-smp  2.6.32-74.142
  linux-image-2.6.32-74-preempt   2.6.32-74.142
  linux-image-2.6.32-74-server    2.6.32-74.142
  linux-image-2.6.32-74-sparc64   2.6.32-74.142
  linux-image-2.6.32-74-sparc64-smp  2.6.32-74.142
  linux-image-2.6.32-74-versatile  2.6.32-74.142
  linux-image-2.6.32-74-virtual   2.6.32-74.142

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

- Ubuntu 14.10

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

Software Description:
- linux: Linux kernel

Details:

Jan Beulich discovered the Xen virtual machine subsystem of the Linux
kernel did not properly restrict access to PCI command registers. A local
guest user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (host
crash). (CVE-2015-2150)

A stack overflow was discovered in the the microcode loader for the intel
x86 platform. A local attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of
service (kernel crash) or to potentially execute code with kernel
privileges. (CVE-2015-2666)

A privilege escalation was discovered in the fork syscal vi the int80 entry
on 64 bit kernels with 32 bit emulation support. An unprivileged local
attacker could exploit this flaw to increase their privileges on the
system. (CVE-2015-2830)

It was discovered that the Linux kernel's IPv6 networking stack has a flaw
that allows using route advertisement (RA) messages to set the 'hop_limit'
to values that are too low. An unprivileged attacker on a local network
could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (IPv6 messages
dropped). (CVE-2015-2922)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 14.10:
  linux-image-3.16.0-36-generic   3.16.0-36.48
  linux-image-3.16.0-36-generic-lpae  3.16.0-36.48
  linux-image-3.16.0-36-lowlatency  3.16.0-36.48
  linux-image-3.16.0-36-powerpc-e500mc  3.16.0-36.48
  linux-image-3.16.0-36-powerpc-smp  3.16.0-36.48
  linux-image-3.16.0-36-powerpc64-emb  3.16.0-36.48
  linux-image-3.16.0-36-powerpc64-smp  3.16.0-36.48

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

Subject: [USN-2591-1] curl vulnerabilities
Message-ID: <55422E79.9010800@canonical.com>

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-2591-1
April 30, 2015

curl vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 15.04
- Ubuntu 14.10
- Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in curl.

Software Description:
- curl: HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP client and client libraries

Details:

Paras Sethia discovered that curl could incorrectly re-use NTLM HTTP
credentials when subsequently connecting to the same host over HTTP.
(CVE-2015-3143)

Hanno B?ck discovered that curl incorrectly handled zero-length host names.
If a user or automated system were tricked into using a specially crafted
host name, an attacker could possibly use this issue to cause curl to
crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary
code. This issue only affected Ubuntu 14.10 and Ubuntu 15.04.
(CVE-2015-3144)

Hanno B?ck discovered that curl incorrectly handled cookie path elements.
If a user or automated system were tricked into parsing a specially crafted
cookie, an attacker could possibly use this issue to cause curl to crash,
resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. This
issue only affected Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, Ubuntu 14.10 and Ubuntu 15.04.
(CVE-2015-3145)

Isaac Boukris discovered that when using Negotiate authenticated
connections, curl could incorrectly authenticate the entire connection and
not just specific HTTP requests. (CVE-2015-3148)

Yehezkel Horowitz and Oren Souroujon discovered that curl sent HTTP headers
both to servers and proxies by default, contrary to expectations. This
issue only affected Ubuntu 14.10 and Ubuntu 15.04. (CVE-2015-3153)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 15.04:
  libcurl3                        7.38.0-3ubuntu2.2
  libcurl3-gnutls                 7.38.0-3ubuntu2.2
  libcurl3-nss                    7.38.0-3ubuntu2.2

Ubuntu 14.10:
  libcurl3                        7.37.1-1ubuntu3.4
  libcurl3-gnutls                 7.37.1-1ubuntu3.4
  libcurl3-nss                    7.37.1-1ubuntu3.4

Ubuntu 14.04 LTS:
  libcurl3                        7.35.0-1ubuntu2.5
  libcurl3-gnutls                 7.35.0-1ubuntu2.5
  libcurl3-nss                    7.35.0-1ubuntu2.5

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:
  libcurl3                        7.22.0-3ubuntu4.14
  libcurl3-gnutls                 7.22.0-3ubuntu4.14
  libcurl3-nss                    7.22.0-3ubuntu4.14

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.

Subject: Ubuntu 10.04 (Lucid Lynx) End of Life reached on April 30, 2015
Message-ID: <20150430184338.GH2018@0c3.net>

This is a follow-up to the End of Life warning sent last month to
confirm that as of today (April 30, 2015), Ubuntu 10.04 is no longer
supported.  No more package updates will be accepted to 10.04, and
it will be archived to old-releases.ubuntu.com in the coming weeks.

The original End of Life warning follows, with upgrade instructions:

Ubuntu announced its 10.04 (Lucid Lynx) release almost 5 years ago,
on April 29, 2010.  As with the earlier LTS releases, Ubuntu committed
to ongoing security and critical fixes for a period of 5 years. The
support period is now nearing its end and Ubuntu 10.04 will reach end
of life on Thursday, April 30th.  At that time, Ubuntu Security Notices
will no longer include information or updated packages for Ubuntu 10.04.

The supported upgrade path from Ubuntu 10.04 is via Ubuntu 12.04.
Users are encouraged to evaluate and upgrade to our latest 14.04 LTS
release via 12.04.  Instructions and caveats for the upgrades may be
found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/PreciseUpgrades and
https://help.ubuntu.com/community/TrustyUpgrades.  Ubuntu 12.04 and
14.04 continue to be actively supported with security updates and
select high-impact bug fixes. All announcements of official security
updates for Ubuntu releases are sent to the ubuntu-security-announce
mailing list, information about which may be found at
https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/ubuntu-security-announce.

Since its launch in October 2004 Ubuntu has become one of the most
highly regarded Linux distributions with millions of users in homes,
schools, businesses and governments around the world. Ubuntu is Open
Source software, costs nothing to download, and users are free to
customise or alter their software in order to meet their needs.

On behalf of the Ubuntu Release Team,

Adam Conrad
