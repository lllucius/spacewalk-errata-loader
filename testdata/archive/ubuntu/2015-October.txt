==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-2759-1
October 01, 2015

linux vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

Software Description:
- linux: Linux kernel

Details:

It was discovered that an integer overflow error existed in the SCSI
generic (sg) driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker with write
permission to a SCSI generic device could use this to cause a denial of
service (system crash) or potentially escalate their privileges.
(CVE-2015-5707)

Marc-Andr? Lureau discovered that the vhost driver did not properly
release the userspace provided log file descriptor. A privileged attacker
could use this to cause a denial of service (resource exhaustion).
(CVE-2015-6252)

It was discovered that the Linux kernel's perf subsystem did not bound
callchain backtraces on PowerPC 64. A local attacker could use this to
cause a denial of service. (CVE-2015-6526)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:
  linux-image-3.2.0-91-generic    3.2.0-91.129
  linux-image-3.2.0-91-generic-pae  3.2.0-91.129
  linux-image-3.2.0-91-highbank   3.2.0-91.129
  linux-image-3.2.0-91-omap       3.2.0-91.129
  linux-image-3.2.0-91-powerpc-smp  3.2.0-91.129
  linux-image-3.2.0-91-powerpc64-smp  3.2.0-91.129
  linux-image-3.2.0-91-virtual    3.2.0-91.129

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

linux vulnerability
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

Summary:

The system could be made to crash or run programs as an administrator.

Software Description:
- linux: Linux kernel

Details:

Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly initialize
IPC object state in certain situations. A local attacker could use this to
escalate their privileges, expose confidential information, or cause a
denial of service (system crash).

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 14.04 LTS:
  linux-image-3.13.0-65-generic   3.13.0-65.106
  linux-image-3.13.0-65-generic-lpae  3.13.0-65.106

  linux-image-3.13.0-65-powerpc-smp  3.13.0-65.106
  linux-image-3.13.0-65-powerpc64-emb  3.13.0-65.106
  linux-image-3.13.0-65-powerpc64-smp  3.13.0-65.106

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

lxc regression
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

Summary:

USN-2753-1 introduced a regression in LXC.

Software Description:
- lxc: Linux Containers userspace tools

Details:

USN-2753-1 fixed a vulnerability in LXC. The update caused a regression
that prevented some containers from starting. This regression only
affected containers that had a path that contained a '/./' directory
specified as a bind mount target in their configuration file. This
update fixes the problem. We apologize for the inconvenience.

Original advisory details:

 Roman Fiedler discovered a directory traversal flaw in lxc-start. A local
 attacker with access to an LXC container could exploit this flaw to run
 programs inside the container that are not confined by AppArmor or expose
 unintended files in the host to the container.

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 14.04 LTS:
  liblxc1                         1.0.7-0ubuntu0.7
  lxc                             1.0.7-0ubuntu0.7
  lxc-dev                         1.0.7-0ubuntu0.7
  lxc-templates                   1.0.7-0ubuntu0.7
  lxc-tests                       1.0.7-0ubuntu0.7
  python3-lxc                     1.0.7-0ubuntu0.7

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.

Subject: [USN-2768-1] Firefox vulnerability
Message-ID: <5620C70C.3020704@canonical.com>

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-2768-1
October 16, 2015

firefox vulnerability
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 15.04
- Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

Summary:

Firefox could be made to expose sensitive information across origins

Software Description:
- firefox: Mozilla Open Source web browser

Details:

Abdulrahman Alqabandi and Ben Kelly discovered that the fetch() API did
not correctly implement the Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)
specification. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted
website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive
information from other origins. (CVE-2015-7184)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 15.04:
  firefox                         41.0.2+build2-0ubuntu0.15.04.1

Ubuntu 14.04 LTS:
  firefox                         41.0.2+build2-0ubuntu0.14.04.1

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:
  firefox                         41.0.2+build2-0ubuntu0.12.04.1

After a standard system update you need to restart Firefox to make
all the necessary changes.

Ubuntu Security Notice USN-2776-1
October 19, 2015

linux vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

Software Description:
- linux: Linux kernel

Details:

It was discovered that the Linux kernel did not check if a new IPv6 MTU set
by a user space application was valid. A remote attacker could forge a
route advertisement with an invalid MTU that a user space daemon like
NetworkManager would honor and apply to the kernel, causing a denial of
service. (CVE-2015-0272)

It was discovered that virtio networking in the Linux kernel did not handle
fragments correctly, leading to kernel memory corruption. A remote attacker
could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly
execute code with administrative privileges. (CVE-2015-5156)

It was discovered that the Reliable Datagram Sockets (RDS) implementation
in the Linux kernel did not verify sockets were properly bound before
attempting to send a message, which could cause a NULL pointer dereference.
An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).
(CVE-2015-6937)

Ben Hutchings discovered that the Advanced Union Filesystem (aufs) for the
Linux kernel did not correctly handle references of memory mapped files
from an aufs mount. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of
service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code with
administrative privileges. (CVE-2015-7312)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 14.04 LTS:
  linux-image-3.13.0-66-generic   3.13.0-66.108
  linux-image-3.13.0-66-generic-lpae  3.13.0-66.108
  linux-image-3.13.0-66-lowlatency  3.13.0-66.108
  linux-image-3.13.0-66-powerpc-e500  3.13.0-66.108
  linux-image-3.13.0-66-powerpc-e500mc  3.13.0-66.108
  linux-image-3.13.0-66-powerpc-smp  3.13.0-66.108
  linux-image-3.13.0-66-powerpc64-emb  3.13.0-66.108
  linux-image-3.13.0-66-powerpc64-smp  3.13.0-66.108

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

It was discovered that ContainerNode::parserInsertBefore in Blink would
incorrectly proceed with a DOM tree insertion in some circumstances. If a
user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker
could potentially exploit this to bypass same origin restrictions.
(CVE-2015-6755)

A use-after-free was discovered in the service worker implementation in
Chromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted
website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of
service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user invoking the program. (CVE-2015-6757)

It was discovered that Blink did not ensure that the origin of
LocalStorage resources are considered unique. If a user were tricked in to
opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit
this to obtain sensitive information. (CVE-2015-6759)

A race condition and memory corruption was discovered in FFmpeg. If a user
were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could
potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash,
or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render
process. (CVE-2015-6761)

It was discovered that CSSFontFaceSrcValue::fetch in Blink did not use
CORS in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a
specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to
bypass same origin restrictions. (CVE-2015-6762)

Multiple security issues were discovered in Chromium. If a user were
tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could
potentially exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial
of service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user invoking the program. (CVE-2015-6763)

Multiple security issues were discovered in V8. If a user were tricked
in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-2779-1
October 20, 2015

linux vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 15.04

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

Software Description:
- linux: Linux kernel

Details:

It was discovered that the Linux kernel did not check if a new IPv6 MTU set
by a user space application was valid. A remote attacker could forge a
route advertisement with an invalid MTU that a user space daemon like
NetworkManager would honor and apply to the kernel, causing a denial of
service. (CVE-2015-0272)

It was discovered that virtio networking in the Linux kernel did not handle
fragments correctly, leading to kernel memory corruption. A remote attacker
could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly
execute code with administrative privileges. (CVE-2015-5156)

It was discovered that the Reliable Datagram Sockets (RDS) implementation
in the Linux kernel did not verify sockets were properly bound before
attempting to send a message, which could cause a NULL pointer dereference.
An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).
(CVE-2015-6937)

Ben Hutchings discovered that the Advanced Union Filesystem (aufs) for the
Linux kernel did not correctly handle references of memory mapped files
from an aufs mount. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of
service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code with
administrative privileges. (CVE-2015-7312)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 15.04:
  linux-image-3.19.0-31-generic   3.19.0-31.36
  linux-image-3.19.0-31-generic-lpae  3.19.0-31.36
  linux-image-3.19.0-31-lowlatency  3.19.0-31.36
  linux-image-3.19.0-31-powerpc-e500mc  3.19.0-31.36
  linux-image-3.19.0-31-powerpc-smp  3.19.0-31.36
  linux-image-3.19.0-31-powerpc64-emb  3.19.0-31.36
  linux-image-3.19.0-31-powerpc64-smp  3.19.0-31.36
