==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-2490-1
February 04, 2015

linux vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

Software Description:
- linux: Linux kernel

Details:

Andy Lutomirski discovered an information leak in the Linux kernel's Thread
Local Storage (TLS) implementation allowing users to bypass the espfix to
obtain information that could be used to bypass the Address Space Layout
Randomization (ASLR) protection mechanism. A local user could exploit this
flaw to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory.
(CVE-2014-8133)

Prasad J Pandit reported a flaw in the rock_continue function of the Linux
kernel's ISO 9660 CDROM file system. A local user could exploit this flaw
to cause a denial of service (system crash or hang). (CVE-2014-9420)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS:
  linux-image-2.6.32-72-386       2.6.32-72.139
  linux-image-2.6.32-72-generic   2.6.32-72.139
  linux-image-2.6.32-72-generic-pae  2.6.32-72.139
  linux-image-2.6.32-72-ia64      2.6.32-72.139
  linux-image-2.6.32-72-lpia      2.6.32-72.139
  linux-image-2.6.32-72-powerpc   2.6.32-72.139
  linux-image-2.6.32-72-powerpc-smp  2.6.32-72.139
  linux-image-2.6.32-72-powerpc64-smp  2.6.32-72.139
  linux-image-2.6.32-72-preempt   2.6.32-72.139
  linux-image-2.6.32-72-server    2.6.32-72.139
  linux-image-2.6.32-72-sparc64   2.6.32-72.139
  linux-image-2.6.32-72-sparc64-smp  2.6.32-72.139
  linux-image-2.6.32-72-versatile  2.6.32-72.139
  linux-image-2.6.32-72-virtual   2.6.32-72.139

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-2496-1
February 09, 2015

binutils vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 14.10
- Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

Summary:

Applications from GNU binutils could be made to crash, run programs,
or delete arbitrary files as your login if they opened a specially
crafted file.

Software Description:
- binutils: GNU assembler, linker and binary utilities

Details:

Michal Zalewski discovered that the setup_group function in libbfd in
GNU binutils did not properly check group headers in ELF files. An
attacker could use this to craft input that could cause a denial
of service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.
(CVE-2014-8485)

Hanno B?ck discovered that the _bfd_XXi_swap_aouthdr_in function
in libbfd in GNU binutils allowed out-of-bounds writes. An
attacker could use this to craft input that could cause a denial
of service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.
(CVE-2014-8501)

Hanno B?ck discovered a heap-based buffer overflow in the
pe_print_edata function in libbfd in GNU binutils. An attacker
could use this to craft input that could cause a denial of service
(application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2014-8502)

Alexander Cherepanov discovered multiple directory traversal
vulnerabilities in GNU binutils. An attacker could use this to craft
input that could delete arbitrary files. (CVE-2014-8737)

Alexander Cherepanov discovered the _bfd_slurp_extended_name_table
function in libbfd in GNU binutils allowed invalid writes when handling
extended name tables in an archive. An attacker could use this to
craft input that could cause a denial of service (application crash)
or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2014-8738)

Hanno B?ck discovered a stack-based buffer overflow in the ihex_scan
function in libbfd in GNU binutils. An attacker could use this
to craft input that could cause a denial of service (application
crash). (CVE-2014-8503)

Michal Zalewski discovered a stack-based buffer overflow in the
srec_scan function in libbfd in GNU binutils. An attacker could
use this to to craft input that could cause a denial of service
(application crash); the GNU C library's Fortify Source printf
protection should prevent the possibility of executing arbitrary code.
(CVE-2014-8504)

Michal Zalewski discovered that the srec_scan function in libbfd
in GNU binutils allowed out-of-bounds reads. An attacker could
use this to craft input to cause a denial of service. This issue
only affected Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, and Ubuntu 10.04
LTS. (CVE-2014-8484)

Sang Kil Cha discovered multiple integer overflows in the
_objalloc_alloc function and objalloc_alloc macro in binutils. This
could allow an attacker to cause a denial of service (application
crash). This issue only affected Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Ubuntu 10.04 LTS.
(CVE-2012-3509)

Alexander Cherepanov and Hanno B?ck discovered multiple additional
out-of-bounds reads and writes in GNU binutils. An attacker could use
these to craft input that could cause a denial of service (application
crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. A few of these issues may
be limited in exposure to a denial of service (application abort)
by the GNU C library's Fortify Source printf protection.

The strings(1) utility in GNU binutils used libbfd by default when
examining executable object files; unfortunately, libbfd was not
originally developed with the expectation of hostile input. As
a defensive measure, the behavior of strings has been changed to
default to 'strings --all' behavior, which does not use libbfd; use
the new argument to strings, '--data', to recreate the old behavior.

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 14.10:
  binutils                        2.24.90.20141014-0ubuntu3.1

oxide-qt vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 14.10
- Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in Oxide.

Software Description:
- oxide-qt: Web browser engine library for Qt (QML plugin)

Details:

A use-after-free bug was discovered in the DOM implementation in Blink. If
a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker
could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer
crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed
render process. (CVE-2015-1209)

It was discovered that V8 did not properly consider frame access
restrictions when throwing exceptions in some circumstances. If a user
were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could
potentially exploit this to bypass same origin restrictions.
(CVE-2015-1210)

It was discovered that Chromium did not properly restrict the URI scheme
during ServiceWorker registration. If a user were tricked in to
downloading and opening a specially crafted HTML file, an attacker could
potentially exploit this to bypass security restrictions. (CVE-2015-1211)

Multiple security issues were discovered in Chromium. If a user were
tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could
potentially exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial
of service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user invoking the program. (CVE-2015-1212)

Message-ID: <54EF05F1.7060702@canonical.com>

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-2511-1
February 26, 2015

linux vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

Software Description:
- linux: Linux kernel

Details:

A race condition was discovered in the Linux kernel's key ring. A local
user could cause a denial of service (memory corruption or panic) or
possibly have unspecified impact via the keyctl commands. (CVE-2014-9529)

A memory leak was discovered in the ISO 9660 CDROM file system when parsing
rock ridge ER records. A local user could exploit this flaw to obtain
sensitive information from kernel memory via a crafted iso9660 image.
(CVE-2014-9584)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS:
  linux-image-2.6.32-73-386       2.6.32-73.140
  linux-image-2.6.32-73-generic   2.6.32-73.140
  linux-image-2.6.32-73-generic-pae  2.6.32-73.140
  linux-image-2.6.32-73-ia64      2.6.32-73.140
  linux-image-2.6.32-73-lpia      2.6.32-73.140
  linux-image-2.6.32-73-powerpc   2.6.32-73.140
  linux-image-2.6.32-73-powerpc-smp  2.6.32-73.140
  linux-image-2.6.32-73-powerpc64-smp  2.6.32-73.140
  linux-image-2.6.32-73-preempt   2.6.32-73.140
  linux-image-2.6.32-73-server    2.6.32-73.140
  linux-image-2.6.32-73-sparc64   2.6.32-73.140
  linux-image-2.6.32-73-sparc64-smp  2.6.32-73.140
  linux-image-2.6.32-73-versatile  2.6.32-73.140
  linux-image-2.6.32-73-virtual   2.6.32-73.140

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

Software Description:
- linux: Linux kernel

Details:

A flaw was discovered in the Kernel Virtual Machine's (KVM) emulation of
the SYSTENTER instruction when the guest OS does not initialize the
SYSENTER MSRs. A guest OS user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of
service of the guest OS (crash) or potentially gain privileges on the guest
OS. (CVE-2015-0239)

A flaw was discovered in the automatic loading of modules in the crypto
subsystem of the Linux kernel. A local user could exploit this flaw to load
installed kernel modules, increasing the attack surface and potentially
using this to gain administrative privileges. (CVE-2013-7421)

Andy Lutomirski discovered a flaw in how the Linux kernel handles
pivot_root when used with a chroot directory. A local user could exploit
this flaw to cause a denial of service (mount-tree loop). (CVE-2014-7970)

A restriction bypass was discovered in iptables when conntrack rules are
specified and the conntrack protocol handler module is not loaded into the
Linux kernel. This flaw can cause the firewall rules on the system to be
bypassed when conntrack rules are used. (CVE-2014-8160)

A race condition was discovered in the Linux kernel's key ring. A local
user could cause a denial of service (memory corruption or panic) or
possibly have unspecified impact via the keyctl commands. (CVE-2014-9529)

A memory leak was discovered in the ISO 9660 CDROM file system when parsing
rock ridge ER records. A local user could exploit this flaw to obtain
sensitive information from kernel memory via a crafted iso9660 image.
(CVE-2014-9584)

A flaw was discovered in the Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) of
the Virtual Dynamically linked Shared Objects (vDSO) location. This flaw
makes it easier for a local user to bypass the ASLR protection mechanism.
(CVE-2014-9585)

A flaw was discovered in the crypto subsystem when screening module names
for automatic module loading if the name contained a valid crypto module
name, eg. vfat(aes). A local user could exploit this flaw to load installed
kernel modules, increasing the attack surface and potentially using this to
gain administrative privileges. (CVE-2014-9644)

Update instructions:

Subject: [USN-2515-1] Linux kernel (Trusty HWE) vulnerabilities
Message-ID: <54EF0688.3070505@canonical.com>

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-2515-1
February 26, 2015

linux-lts-trusty vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

Software Description:
- linux-lts-trusty: Linux hardware enablement kernel from Trusty

Details:

A flaw was discovered in the Kernel Virtual Machine's (KVM) emulation of
the SYSTENTER instruction when the guest OS does not initialize the
SYSENTER MSRs. A guest OS user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of
service of the guest OS (crash) or potentially gain privileges on the guest
OS. (CVE-2015-0239)

Andy Lutomirski discovered an information leak in the Linux kernel's Thread
Local Storage (TLS) implementation allowing users to bypass the espfix to
obtain information that could be used to bypass the Address Space Layout
Randomization (ASLR) protection mechanism. A local user could exploit this
flaw to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory.
(CVE-2014-8133)

A restriction bypass was discovered in iptables when conntrack rules are
specified and the conntrack protocol handler module is not loaded into the
Linux kernel. This flaw can cause the firewall rules on the system to be
bypassed when conntrack rules are used. (CVE-2014-8160)

A flaw was discovered with file renaming in the linux kernel. A local user
could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (deadlock and system
hang). (CVE-2014-8559)

A flaw was discovered in how supplemental group memberships are handled in
certain namespace scenarios. A local user could exploit this flaw to bypass
file permission restrictions. (CVE-2014-8989)

A flaw was discovered in how Thread Local Storage (TLS) is handled by the
task switching function in the Linux kernel for x86_64 based machines. A
local user could exploit this flaw to bypass the Address Space Layout
Radomization (ASLR) protection mechanism. (CVE-2014-9419)

Prasad J Pandit reported a flaw in the rock_continue function of the Linux
kernel's ISO 9660 CDROM file system. A local user could exploit this flaw
to cause a denial of service (system crash or hang). (CVE-2014-9420)

A flaw was discovered in the fragment handling of the B.A.T.M.A.N. Advanced
Meshing Protocol in the Linux kernel. A remote attacker could exploit this
flaw to cause a denial of service (mesh-node system crash) via fragmented
packets. (CVE-2014-9428)

A race condition was discovered in the Linux kernel's key ring. A local
user could cause a denial of service (memory corruption or panic) or
possibly have unspecified impact via the keyctl commands. (CVE-2014-9529)

A memory leak was discovered in the ISO 9660 CDROM file system when parsing
rock ridge ER records. A local user could exploit this flaw to obtain
sensitive information from kernel memory via a crafted iso9660 image.
(CVE-2014-9584)

A flaw was discovered in the Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) of
the Virtual Dynamically linked Shared Objects (vDSO) location. This flaw
makes it easier for a local user to bypass the ASLR protection mechanism.
(CVE-2014-9585)

Dmitry Chernenkov discovered a buffer overflow in eCryptfs' encrypted file
name decoding. A local unprivileged user could exploit this flaw to cause a
denial of service (system crash) or potentially gain administrative
privileges. (CVE-2014-9683)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:
  linux-image-3.13.0-46-generic   3.13.0-46.75~precise1
  linux-image-3.13.0-46-generic-lpae  3.13.0-46.75~precise1

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in the GNU C Library.

Software Description:
- glibc: GNU C Library
- eglibc: GNU C Library

Details:

Arnaud Le Blanc discovered that the GNU C Library incorrectly handled file
descriptors when resolving DNS queries under high load. This may cause a
denial of service in other applications, or an information leak. This issue
only affected Ubuntu 10.04 LTS, Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.
(CVE-2013-7423)

It was discovered that the GNU C Library incorrectly handled receiving a
positive answer while processing the network name when performing DNS
resolution. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause the GNU C
Library to hang, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2014-9402)

Joseph Myers discovered that the GNU C Library wscanf function incorrectly
handled memory. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause
the GNU C Library to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly
execute arbitrary code. This issue only affected Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, Ubuntu
14.04 LTS and Ubuntu 14.10. (CVE-2015-1472, CVE-2015-1473)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 14.10:
  libc6                           2.19-10ubuntu2.3

Ubuntu 14.04 LTS:
  libc6                           2.19-0ubuntu6.6

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:
  libc6                           2.15-0ubuntu10.11

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS:
  libc6                           2.11.1-0ubuntu7.21

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

Subject: [USN-2516-2] Linux kernel vulnerability regression
Message-ID: <54F18B5B.7080803@canonical.com>

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-2516-2
February 28, 2015

linux vulnerability
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

Summary:

USN-2516-1 introduced a regression in the Linux kernel.

Software Description:
- linux: Linux kernel

Details:

USN-2516-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel. There was an unrelated
regression in the use of the virtual counter (CNTVCT) on arm64 architectures.
This update fixes the problem.

We apologize for the inconvenience.

Original advisory details:

A flaw was discovered in the Kernel Virtual Machine's (KVM) emulation of
the SYSTENTER instruction when the guest OS does not initialize the
SYSENTER MSRs. A guest OS user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of
service of the guest OS (crash) or potentially gain privileges on the guest
OS. (CVE-2015-0239)

Andy Lutomirski discovered an information leak in the Linux kernel's Thread
Local Storage (TLS) implementation allowing users to bypass the espfix to
obtain information that could be used to bypass the Address Space Layout
Randomization (ASLR) protection mechanism. A local user could exploit this
flaw to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory.
(CVE-2014-8133)

A restriction bypass was discovered in iptables when conntrack rules are
specified and the conntrack protocol handler module is not loaded into the
Linux kernel. This flaw can cause the firewall rules on the system to be
bypassed when conntrack rules are used. (CVE-2014-8160)

A flaw was discovered with file renaming in the linux kernel. A local user
could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (deadlock and system
hang). (CVE-2014-8559)

A flaw was discovered in how supplemental group memberships are handled in
certain namespace scenarios. A local user could exploit this flaw to bypass
file permission restrictions. (CVE-2014-8989)

A flaw was discovered in how Thread Local Storage (TLS) is handled by the
task switching function in the Linux kernel for x86_64 based machines. A
local user could exploit this flaw to bypass the Address Space Layout
Radomization (ASLR) protection mechanism. (CVE-2014-9419)

Prasad J Pandit reported a flaw in the rock_continue function of the Linux
kernel's ISO 9660 CDROM file system. A local user could exploit this flaw
to cause a denial of service (system crash or hang). (CVE-2014-9420)

A flaw was discovered in the fragment handling of the B.A.T.M.A.N. Advanced
Meshing Protocol in the Linux kernel. A remote attacker could exploit this
flaw to cause a denial of service (mesh-node system crash) via fragmented
packets. (CVE-2014-9428)

A race condition was discovered in the Linux kernel's key ring. A local
user could cause a denial of service (memory corruption or panic) or
possibly have unspecified impact via the keyctl commands. (CVE-2014-9529)

A memory leak was discovered in the ISO 9660 CDROM file system when parsing
rock ridge ER records. A local user could exploit this flaw to obtain
sensitive information from kernel memory via a crafted iso9660 image.
(CVE-2014-9584)

A flaw was discovered in the Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) of
the Virtual Dynamically linked Shared Objects (vDSO) location. This flaw
makes it easier for a local user to bypass the ASLR protection mechanism.
(CVE-2014-9585)

Dmitry Chernenkov discovered a buffer overflow in eCryptfs' encrypted file
name decoding. A local unprivileged user could exploit this flaw to cause a
denial of service (system crash) or potentially gain administrative
privileges. (CVE-2014-9683)
