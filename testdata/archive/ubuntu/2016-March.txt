openssl vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 15.10
- Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in OpenSSL.

Software Description:
- openssl: Secure Socket Layer (SSL) cryptographic library and tools

Details:

Yuval Yarom, Daniel Genkin, and Nadia Heninger discovered that OpenSSL was
vulnerable to a side-channel attack on modular exponentiation. On certain
CPUs, a local attacker could possibly use this issue to recover RSA keys.
This flaw is known as CacheBleed. (CVE-2016-0702)

Adam Langley discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled memory when
parsing DSA private keys. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause
OpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute
arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-0705)

Guido Vranken discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled hex digit
calculation in the BN_hex2bn function. A remote attacker could use this
issue to cause OpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or
possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-0797)

Emilia K?sper discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled memory when
performing SRP user database lookups. A remote attacker could possibly use
this issue to cause OpenSSL to consume memory, resulting in a denial of
service. (CVE-2016-0798)

Guido Vranken discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled memory when
printing very long strings. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause
OpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute
arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-0799)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 15.10:
  libssl1.0.0                     1.0.2d-0ubuntu1.4

Subject: [USN-2927-1] graphite2 vulnerabilities
Message-ID: <56E6C385.3090002@canonical.com>

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-2927-1
March 14, 2016

graphite2 vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 15.10
- Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

Summary:

graphite2 could be made to crash or run programs as your login if it opened
a specially crafted font.

Software Description:
- graphite2: Font rendering engine for Complex Scripts

Details:

It was discovered that graphite2 incorrectly handled certain malformed
fonts. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a specially-
crafted font file, a remote attacker could use this issue to cause
graphite2 to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute
arbitrary code.

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 15.10:
  libgraphite2-3                  1.3.6-1ubuntu0.15.10.1

Ubuntu 14.04 LTS:
  libgraphite2-3                  1.3.6-1ubuntu0.14.04.1

This update uses a new upstream release, which includes additional bug
fixes. After a standard system update you need to restart applications
using graphite2, such as LibreOffice, to make all the necessary changes.

Ubuntu Security Notice USN-2928-1
March 14, 2016

linux vulnerability
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

Summary:

The system could be made to crash or run programs as an administrator by
someone with physical access.

Software Description:
- linux: Linux kernel

Details:

Andrey Konovalov discovered that the ALSA USB MIDI driver incorrectly
performed a double-free. A local attacker with physical access could use
this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute
arbitrary code with administrative privileges.

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:
  linux-image-3.2.0-101-generic   3.2.0-101.141
  linux-image-3.2.0-101-generic-pae  3.2.0-101.141
  linux-image-3.2.0-101-highbank  3.2.0-101.141
  linux-image-3.2.0-101-omap      3.2.0-101.141
  linux-image-3.2.0-101-powerpc-smp  3.2.0-101.141
  linux-image-3.2.0-101-powerpc64-smp  3.2.0-101.141
  linux-image-3.2.0-101-virtual   3.2.0-101.141

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.
Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages
(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,
linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform
this as well.

(CVE-2016-3135)

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the USB driver for Clie devices in the
Linux kernel did not properly sanity check the endpoints reported by the
device. An attacker with physical access could cause a denial of service
(system crash). (CVE-2015-7566)

It was discovered that a race condition existed when handling heartbeat-
timeout events in the SCTP implementation of the Linux kernel. A remote
attacker could use this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2015-8767)

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the ioctl handler for
the TTY driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to
cause a denial of service (system crash) or expose sensitive information.
(CVE-2016-0723)

Andrey Konovalov discovered that the ALSA USB MIDI driver incorrectly
performed a double-free. A local attacker with physical access could use
this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute
arbitrary code with administrative privileges. (CVE-2016-2384)

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the USB driver for Treo devices in the
Linux kernel did not properly sanity check the endpoints reported by the
device. An attacker with physical access could cause a denial of service
(system crash). (CVE-2016-2782)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 14.04 LTS:
  linux-image-4.2.0-34-generic    4.2.0-34.39~14.04.1
  linux-image-4.2.0-34-generic-lpae  4.2.0-34.39~14.04.1
  linux-image-4.2.0-34-lowlatency  4.2.0-34.39~14.04.1
  linux-image-4.2.0-34-powerpc-e500mc  4.2.0-34.39~14.04.1
  linux-image-4.2.0-34-powerpc-smp  4.2.0-34.39~14.04.1
  linux-image-4.2.0-34-powerpc64-emb  4.2.0-34.39~14.04.1
  linux-image-4.2.0-34-powerpc64-smp  4.2.0-34.39~14.04.1

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.
Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages
(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,
linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform
this as well.

linux-lts-utopic vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

Software Description:
- linux-lts-utopic: Linux hardware enablement kernel from Utopic for Trusty

Details:

Ben Hawkes discovered that the Linux netfilter implementation did not
correctly perform validation when handling IPT_SO_SET_REPLACE events. A
local unprivileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service
(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code with administrative
privileges. (CVE-2016-3134)

It was discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly enforce rlimits
for file descriptors sent over UNIX domain sockets. A local attacker could
use this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2013-4312)

It was discovered that a race condition existed when handling heartbeat-
timeout events in the SCTP implementation of the Linux kernel. A remote
attacker could use this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2015-8767)

Subject: [USN-2933-1] Exim vulnerabilities
Message-ID: <56E80534.10807@canonical.com>

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-2933-1
March 15, 2016

exim4 vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 15.10
- Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in Exim.

Software Description:
- exim4: Exim is a mail transport agent

Details:

It was discovered that Exim incorrectly filtered environment variables when
used with the perl_startup configuration option. If the perl_startup option
was enabled, a local attacker could use this issue to escalate their
privileges to the root user. This issue has been fixed by having Exim clean
the complete execution environment by default on startup, including any
subprocesses such as transports that call other programs. This change in
behaviour may break existing installations and can be adjusted by using two
new configuration options, keep_environment and add_environment.
(CVE-2016-1531)

Patrick William discovered that Exim incorrectly expanded mathematical
comparisons twice. A local attacker could possibly use this issue to
perform arbitrary file operations as the Exim user. This issue only
affected Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. (CVE-2014-2972)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 15.10:
  exim4-daemon-heavy              4.86-3ubuntu1.1
  exim4-daemon-light              4.86-3ubuntu1.1

Ubuntu 14.04 LTS:
  exim4-daemon-custom             4.82-3ubuntu2.1
  exim4-daemon-heavy              4.82-3ubuntu2.1
  exim4-daemon-light              4.82-3ubuntu2.1

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:
  exim4-daemon-custom             4.76-3ubuntu3.3
  exim4-daemon-heavy              4.76-3ubuntu3.3
  exim4-daemon-light              4.76-3ubuntu3.3

This update introduces environment filtering, which may break certain
existing installations. After performing a standard system update, the new
keep_environment and add_environment configurations options can be used
to adjust the new behaviour.

Subject: [USN-2930-3] Linux kernel (Raspberry Pi 2) vulnerabilities
Message-ID: <20160316134134.GK14930@nxnw.org>

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-2930-3
March 16, 2016

linux-raspi2 vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 15.10

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

Software Description:
- linux-raspi2: Linux kernel for Raspberry Pi 2

Details:

Ben Hawkes discovered that the Linux netfilter implementation did not
correctly perform validation when handling IPT_SO_SET_REPLACE events. A
local unprivileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service
(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code with administrative
privileges. (CVE-2016-3134)

Ben Hawkes discovered an integer overflow in the Linux netfilter
implementation. On systems running 32 bit kernels, a local unprivileged
attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or
possibly execute arbitrary code with administrative privileges.
(CVE-2016-3135)

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the USB driver for Clie devices in the
Linux kernel did not properly sanity check the endpoints reported by the
device. An attacker with physical access could cause a denial of service
(system crash). (CVE-2015-7566)

It was discovered that a race condition existed when handling heartbeat-
timeout events in the SCTP implementation of the Linux kernel. A remote
attacker could use this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2015-8767)

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the ioctl handler for
the TTY driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to
cause a denial of service (system crash) or expose sensitive information.
(CVE-2016-0723)

Andrey Konovalov discovered that the ALSA USB MIDI driver incorrectly
performed a double-free. A local attacker with physical access could use
this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute
arbitrary code with administrative privileges. (CVE-2016-2384)

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the USB driver for Treo devices in the
Linux kernel did not properly sanity check the endpoints reported by the
device. An attacker with physical access could cause a denial of service
(system crash). (CVE-2016-2782)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 15.10:
  linux-image-4.2.0-1027-raspi2   4.2.0-1027.35

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.
Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages
(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,
linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform
this as well.

Subject: [USN-2943-1] PCRE vulnerabilities
Message-ID: <56FABF51.3040505@canonical.com>

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-2943-1
March 29, 2016

pcre3 vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 15.10
- Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

Summary:

PCRE could be made to crash or run programs if it processed a
specially-crafted regular expression.

Software Description:
- pcre3: Perl 5 Compatible Regular Expression Library

Details:

It was discovered that PCRE incorrectly handled certain regular
expressions. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause applications
using PCRE to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute
arbitrary code.

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 15.10:
  libpcre3                        2:8.35-7.1ubuntu1.3

Ubuntu 14.04 LTS:
  libpcre3                        1:8.31-2ubuntu2.2

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:
  libpcre3                        8.12-4ubuntu0.2

After a standard system update you need to restart applications using PCRE,
such as the Apache HTTP server and Nginx, to make all the necessary
changes.
